<p>Dear Bride of Christ,</p>

<p>I love you with a relentless passion that I can&#8217;t abandon no matter how ugly or derisive you become. You are the creation and beloved of my Beloved, and so I am inseparably part of you. So, since I can&#8217;t leave (which is what I&#8217;m best trained in doing), I need to have a literal &#8220;Come to Jesus&#8221; chat with you.</p>

<p>You &#8211; we &#8211; have forgotten our First Love. This week&#8217;s fallout hasn&#8217;t just been about the election and two incredibly flawed candidates and grotesquely mutated systems. Yes, that is what evoked the vitriol &#8211; one side crying out, &#8220;You don&#8217;t care about the unborn!&#8221; and the other retaliating with, &#8220;You don&#8217;t care about the marginalized!&#8221; &#8211; but the division and contempt has long been there.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we serve a God who doesn&#8217;t accept Band-Aid and make-nice solutions; sadly, our simmering turned to boiling with these catalysts and led us to a civil war for all the world to see.</p>

<p>So we are sitting in the aftermath, our fractures exposed and on display. And we have a choice: Will we continue on gloating without taking the time to understand, and condemning without taking the time to weigh our words for the Spirit&#8217;s grace-filled wisdom?</p>

<p>Because that hasn&#8217;t worked thus far. And that isn&#8217;t our Savior&#8217;s agenda. <strong>Our Savior came to unify through His transformational love diverse and disparate groups so He&nbsp; can use us all to restore His creation, not to come up with the best comment zinger on a blog we disagree with.</strong> In fact, He probably would not spend much time at all reading blogs (including this one).</p>

<p>I have had two trees in my yard die. They had dead branches for a while, and then the whole tree gave up the ghost. That is too vivid a truth for me to ignore. A little bit of disease or neglect must never be avoided or hidden.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%205&version=ESV;MSG" target="_blank">Galatians 5:7-10</a> tells us what happens to those who get in the way of the Gospel message of freedom and love through Christ alone. <strong>If we&#8217;re part of the division, we won&#8217;t be spared the penalty.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So let&#8217;s take a radical step to save our tree with its dying branches. Instead of debating the theology of what I&#8217;m saying here or calling out other siblings by the Savior in an unloving, uncompassionate way that is not at all our Redeemer&#8217;s style, let&#8217;s all commit to pray for those with whom we disagree before we say <em>anything</em>. Then reach out to those we may not understand and ask gracious questions if we must converse. Nonetheless, let&#8217;s always focus on God&#8217;s love, with <em>learning</em> and <em>unity</em> as the outcome &#8211; and that doesn&#8217;t mean making them learn our side and be united to it.</p>

<p>Bride, we have a black eye we gave ourselves. So let&#8217;s put healing back as a priority so we can resume the work of the One who called us, who has been waiting for us to return to His open arms &#8211; together. He has a lot of other stuff for us to do, and I promise it involves very little blog commenting.</p>

<p>By His grace &amp; in His time,</p>

<p>&#8211;j</p>

<p>P.S. Please listen to this song. We need to sing it together every day.</p>
