    <p>Sadness isn&#8217;t an easy feeling for us. Anger is easy because it&#8217;s in motion. It helps us feel like we&#8217;re doing something. But sadness has a purpose &#8211; if nothing else, &#8216;Inside Out&#8217; should have taught us that.</p>

<p>Yes, we need to be angry about what happened yesterday in Orlando. I&#8217;m pissed like a bee-stung mama bear that anyone would so brutally harm my fellow beloved creations of God, that my LGBTQ brothers &amp; sisters yet again feel victimized.</p>

<p>But, my friends, we still need to <em>mourn</em>! We must not rush past this moment to reflect on each of these unique lives lost or compromised in this tragedy.</p>

<p>In less than a month, we have been outraged by restrooms, a gorilla/parenting controversy, a rapist, and now this mass shooting. And all this anger eventually leads to outrage fatigue &#8211; AKA apathy &amp; inaction. We owe it to our fellow humans today to mourn, to grieve each of their lives, to not bypass our sadness, running straight to anger and &#8211; as we flawed creatures often do &#8211; careen into hatred (no matter how we righteously justify it). Anger &amp; action can then follow, but our hearts need to feel the weight of the loss <em>first</em> to guide our next steps.</p>

<p>Today, I will be teaching my kids to hold space for these lives, to sit with the sadness as I would want others to do for us. They&#8217;re too young for candles, so maybe we&#8217;ll make snowflakes and talk about loving one another. Please take time to grieve with us today.</p>
