      <h1>Digesting with gratitude</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Dear patrons of the local Mexican restaurant my family frequents,</p>

<p>Thank you for allowing my husband and me to argue in your midst. Thank you for averting your eyes and not [audibly] questioning our decision to hash it all out in front of our young children. This has been a long journey for us to get to this place in our marriage, where we can be real with each other and show our disagreements instead of forced pleasantries.</p>

<p>Unlike our children, we did not witness many couples who loved each other arguing and then reconciling. Perhaps that is why we do not always fight fair; nonetheless, we are learning, and so are our daughter and two sons.</p>

<p>And thank you, staff, for giving us space so we could have this honest &#8211; and heated &#8211; discussion. You were attentive but not intrusive. It can be hard to have such tension in your establishment, and I can assure you we plan to return without gloves on. That&#8217;s what reconciliation looks like, and we do it well because we&#8217;ve had a lot of practice.</p>

<p>Gratefully yours,</p>

<p>A couple still in training</p>
