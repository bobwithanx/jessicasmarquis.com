      <h1>Eating Hands</h1>
    </header>

    <p>My kiddos are adorable, but not brilliant. At least, not yet. When I go to nurse their hungry little 4-month-old mouths, I often find they have preemptively shoved a fist into it. In an effort to sate their appetite, they find something that works in a tactile way but not nutritionally.</p>

<p>If only they knew to wait! That their mama is equipped and happy to provide them with what they need to thrive!</p>

<p>And yet I do this so often with my own loving Daddy. I&#8217;m hungry, desiring something that could very well be good for me, but before He meets that hunger I stuff my face (figuratively) with something inadequate, but something I can control.</p>

<p>In time, my boys will learn to keep their hands out of the way when it comes time to eat, just as their older sister eventually did. I pray that I will, too.</p>

<p>~Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not</p>

<p>satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will</p>

<p>delight in the richest of fare.~</p>
