    <br> <div class="content text-justify"><p>&#8220;All meat, no parsley.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been labeled a carnivore, but I love that phrase. It describes my thinking, and why I don&#8217;t like reading most blogs &#8211; or writing them very often.</p>

<p>The metaphor was uttered at Prism :: Gifts, an event I attended yesterday for women wanting to discover their spiritual gifts and how to use them. It was glorious in the way spending a day with open-hearted sisters who want to be real and effective is glorious. There were tears and dancing and cake pops, and writing this now makes it sound like a bizarro lovefest adorned with pink flowers. But being in it &#8211; participating in the prayers that spoke life and redirected lives, listening to women share how having their voices silenced has caused them now to speak truth all the louder &#8211; was no ladies&#8217; tea party.</p>

<p>I have long been an advocate for knowing and applying one&#8217;s gifts, and my dad taught courses in it when he was a pastor. The problem is that not everyone has caught the vision cast by God via Paul in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and Ephesians 4. A lot of churches I&#8217;ve been in seem to have viewed spiritual gifts as an afterthought, a luxury to dabble in once all the volunteer spots are filled with whomever is available regardless of their holy wiring.</p>

<p>And that is likely why I fell into doing all kinds of ministries for which I was not suited. I wanted to obey the instructions in the Bible to serve, so I volunteered wherever I was able. <strong>It was good to give, yes, but what I didn&#8217;t realize is that I was called to serve <em>using the gifts He had given me</em>.</strong> Plus, I had gotten pretty good at thinking I could do anything if I needed to (we codependents are adorably delusional like that), so I wasn&#8217;t even sure what my gifts were.</p>

<p>I often tell people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t serve where you aren&#8217;t gifted. You&#8217;re taking up the space where the person who has that gift should be, and you&#8217;ll burn yourself out.&#8221; But what if you think you <em>are</em> in your gifting? What if you don&#8217;t realize what it&#8217;s like to be squarely alive in your unique passion?</p>

<p>The direct answers to those questions for me have been:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Take a solid spiritual gifts assessment like <a href="https://amzn.com/080079740X" target="_blank">this one</a>,</p></li>

<li><p>Read about your results,</p></li>

<li><p>Talk to people who know about spiritual gifts for further clarification and equipping, and</p></li>

<li><p>Get involved in serving with your gift(s).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Which brings me to now. The past few years have involved me confronting the uncomfortable reality that I am a leader. I&#8217;ve used a lot of other gifts to get around it &#8211; I&#8217;m really good at administration, teaching, and encouraging &#8211; but I love to lead when God opens that door. My life resume is replete in every single area with examples of me taking the reigns or emerging from a crowd or going my own direction. Okay, usually just that last one. But then I would turn around and see that people had followed me.</p>

<p>Being a leader is not a popular gift, especially for women, and I was content to simply lead small and avoid the responsibility of more consequential matters.</p>

<p>But &#8220;content&#8221; is kinda like a swear word to the Spirit &#8211; at least, in this context. And my own spirit was growing restless with this arrangement. Those two sentences are probably more related than the period between them would lead you to believe.</p>

<p>What was left for me to do? I owned it. I owned that my Creator designed me to be a leader, to cast visions and unite people. I owned that the other gifts have influenced the type of leader I am, but that I need to step out from behind their protection and allow myself to be unpopular, criticized, and unable to meet the crazy expectations assigned to me. This is how I serve, and by enduring these things I get to be me, energized in my perfect fit. I get to act out Ephesians 2:10: <em>For we are Godâ€™s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.</em></p>

<p>We closed the event with the Parable of the Talents in Matthew 25:14-30. During the reading, I realized I hadn&#8217;t intentionally buried my talent; I had simply concealed the controversial parts of it and packaged the rest with other talents to make it more palatable. In doing so, though, I hadn&#8217;t invested it as well as I could have.</p>

<p>I doubt I&#8217;m the only one. In fact, I know I&#8217;m not the only one. For starters, the Founder of Prism Women, <a href="http://www.prismwomen.com/about/" target="_blank">Renee Ronika</a>, is unapologetically open about her struggle to accept her gift as a prophet. Other women who attended previous events and were present as leaders at this one shared similar stories of discovering and claiming their gifts. <strong>The good news: Owning your spiritual gift will cause your life to make more sense.</strong> It may not get easier, but knowing this Spirit-infused part of you will provide a sort of bigger-picture mission statement that gives confidence and purpose to each step.</p>

<p>So the parsley is getting tossed, and my plate is now home to a giant rib-eye. Or a pile of lobster tales, which is infinitely more appetizing to me. I don&#8217;t even know if a giant rib-eye is a thing.</p>

<p>But the parsley is definitely gone.</p>
