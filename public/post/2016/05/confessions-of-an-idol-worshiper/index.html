  <div class="content text-justify"><p>Once upon a time, people worshiped idols. They were made of wood or clay or stone. They looked like creatures, and they couldn&#8217;t do anything. These ancient people were silly for thinking the idols could help them. Now, we are so much better and smarter, and we don&#8217;t have idols.</p>

<p>This was the story I told myself growing up in the Church.</p>

<p>And then my Sunday school teacher informed me TV could be an idol. That didn&#8217;t quite jive with my definitions of idols. TV didn&#8217;t look like a monkey or a human with extra appendages. So she explained it to me.</p>

<p>Thus, I expanded my definition to be something to which you give lots of time and attention.</p>

<p>And then my pastor told me work could be an idol.</p>

<p>Okay, I could understand the TV thing, since it was a physical entity. But work was intangible. How could people bow to it? So he explained it to me.</p>

<p>Thus, I expanded my definition to be something to which you give space in your heart where other life-giving things have more claim.</p>

<p>And then an author told me family could be an idol.</p>

<p>What the&#8230;?</p>

<p>This one was a bit too out there for my operational definition. Wasn&#8217;t family a thing the Church loved, a thing that brought life, that embodies love and exemplifies community? How could it be an idol? So the Spirit explained it to me.</p>

<p>Thus, I expanded my definition to be anything that can become my prime motivation, crowding God off His throne in my life.</p>

<p>That revision caused just about everything else in my life to light up as potential idols: Approval, fear, helping others, knowledge, grudges, dreams, theology, identity, exercising (okay, not really, but I kinda wish exercising was something I struggled with idolizing).&nbsp; <strong>Anything that occupied my thoughts and informed my goals more than my Savior would end up in His crosshairs. He&#8217;s a jealous God; He wants all of my heart.</strong></p>

<p>Family is a beautiful thing, but it must never get in the way of what God is calling us into. We need to regularly surrender our spouse, kids, parents, siblings &#8211; or our desire for these things &#8211; to the One who gives them to us. We need to keep a loose grip so He can slide His hand in there at any time (for <em>all</em> of our best).</p>

<p>When my son was ill and eventually ended up in the hospital, it rocked me. No mom wants to hear the pediatrician say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried everything. It&#8217;s time to admit him.&#8221; But having him in my open hand, knowing he was on loan to me by his Creator &#8211; <em>our</em> Creator &#8211; made the journey one where I was walking alongside that Creator instead of fighting Him. It made it a sweet adventure even amidst the uncertainty, and the healing that much more dynamic.</p>

<p><strong>We all struggle with idols, no matter how self-aware, humble, or God-focused we are. Once we accept that basic truth of our humanity, we can then begin to identify what needs to be dethroned.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s Idol Identification-and-Removal Routine:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask, &#8220;What, if taken from me, do I believe would ruin me irreversibly?&#8221;</p></li>

<li><p>Once the Spirit answers and shows you an idol, don&#8217;t deny it. You&#8217;ll eventually have to let go of it anyway, so my recommendation (from experience) is to do it sooner and voluntarily, rather than later and with a lot more discomfort. It&#8217;s like tending to a splinter: Pull it out when you see it, rather than letting it stay, start an infection, and require surgery.</p></li>

<li><p>Invite the King back to His throne. What makes an idol &#8211; thinking it can help you, time, attention, space in your heart, being your motivation &#8211; is also what restores your King to His rightful place.</p></li>

<li><p>Repeat. Regularly.</p></li>
</ol>
