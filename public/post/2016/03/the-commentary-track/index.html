  <div class="content text-justify"><p>I recently came across a sort of time capsule that perfectly exemplified where I was at during that point in my spiritual life. Rarely does a time capsule perfectly fulfill what it&#8217;s supposed to do &#8211; make the recipient into a time traveler &#8211; but this one put me squarely in my thought process of 2009 Jessica.</p>

<p>The item was a treatment for an animation I was proposing at that time for my friend, Kristen. Based off the Parable of the Seeds and the Sower, it represented the weeds as deliverers of luxury that blinded the sprout to the route to true growth, eventually suffocating the sprout due to its anemic condition. I contrasted that with another sprout that refused the allure of the easy life and &#8211; with focus, determination, and speed &#8211; grew strong and tall.</p>

<p>As I reread the story, I could hear my present self talking to this self from seven years ago (a la <a href="http://verses3to5.com/" target="_blank"><i>Verses 3 to 5</i></a>): &#8220;Yes, this is all true, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>I sat down for a rewrite and found myself stripping it to its skeleton. And then I did something that is Me Now but not Me Then: I asked for help.</p>

<p>My mom and I sat together and discussed how to portray the weeds in light of revelations I&#8217;ve had over the course of these years. <strong>See, it isn&#8217;t just comfort, convenience, and security that distract us from growth &#8211; so do busyness, pride, self-pity, fear, sneaky forms of idolatry, and pain.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>While we talked, I could feel gratitude simmering within my heart that my loving Daddy has been so gracious to open my eyes to things I was unable to see then. Slowly, methodically, in a pace that has allowed me to learn, retain, and apply these lessons, He has been teaching my heart volumes about Him and my life in Him.</p>

<p>And that imperceptible progress, and this conversation with my mom, and my own mistakes along the entire way caused friction with the way I had written the journey of the two sprouts. Instead of the second sprout purposing to powerfully push forward like a lone wolf with a map and a jet pack, I realized that it could not go it alone. The sprout was going to be tempted &#8211; even Jesus was, according to Luke 4:2 &#8211; and it was going to need to move unhurriedly, intentionally so it could have the space to make tough decisions. Lastly, and one of the biggest realizations of all for me, <strong>it needed to grow alongside others.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><em>If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble.</em></p>

<p>Ecclesiastes 4:10 (NLT)</p>

<p>The story took on new life after that, and I can&#8217;t wait to see what the Sower has in mind for it now. Plus, the resulting ending scene is like an Ebenezer to God&#8217;s help in my <i>own</i> life, how He has shifted my paradigms of what it means to grow and be alive in Him.</p>

<p>Of course, I recognize that in another seven years, I may reread this entry and think, &#8220;Yes, this is all true, but&#8230;&#8221; And it reminds me of what one of my friends used to say when people asked him why he only quoted great thinkers who were dead: &#8220;They can&#8217;t change their minds.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today, I&#8217;m grateful Daddy has allowed me to change my mind.&nbsp;</p>
