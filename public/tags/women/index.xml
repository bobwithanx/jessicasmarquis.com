      <description>&amp;#8220;All meat, no parsley.&amp;#8221;
I&amp;#8217;ve never been labeled a carnivore, but I love that phrase. It describes my thinking, and why I don&amp;#8217;t like reading most blogs &amp;#8211; or writing them very often.
The metaphor was uttered at Prism :: Gifts, an event I attended yesterday for women wanting to discover their spiritual gifts and how to use them. It was glorious in the way spending a day with open-hearted sisters who want to be real and effective is glorious.</description>

      <title>Casting CAST</title>

      <description>The general consensus was that no one&amp;#8217;s husband thought they should be there.
With a theme like &amp;#8220;Busyness&amp;#8221;, it&amp;#8217;s hard to find a woman who can speak to the topic as an expert at managing it. And even if she does exist, none of us could relate to her, which was what the event was about.
These women were sitting in confession via a stage in front of a couple dozen of their sisters.</description>

      <title>Too Close to Define</title>

      <description>You know that experience when you&amp;#8217;re so close to something you can&amp;#8217;t really say anything about it? When it&amp;#8217;s feels like you&amp;#8217;re trying to build something and discover you&amp;#8217;re using water instead of packing snow? When you&amp;#8217;re afraid a remark about it would only touch part and miss the whole?
I remember someone joking that if you need the definition of &amp;#8220;psychology&amp;#8221;, you should [counterintuitively] ask the first-semester psych major, not the PhD clinician.</description>
