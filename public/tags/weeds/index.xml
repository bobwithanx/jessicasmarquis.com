      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about weeds,
particularly the ones in the parable of the sower.
in the first two scenarios the seeds didn&amp;#8217;t really get much of a chance:
birds ate &amp;#8217;em or the sun scorched &amp;#8217;em because they didn&amp;#8217;t really have good roots.
but in the third scenario,
the weeds,
the seeds were able to burrow down &amp;amp; begin to grow.
their success was compromised not by the soil but by the setting.</description>
