      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t know many people who are great at hearing the word, &amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;
In fact, as I typed that statement, I attempted to tally up everyone in my mental Rolodex who could graciously accept a negative response, and no one popped up. There has to be at least one person I know who is gifted in that area; I just don&amp;#8217;t have them on speed-dial for it.
And as I typed that last paragraph, I realized there is a large portion of the population who would not know what I was talking about when I referenced &amp;#8220;Rolodex&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;speed-dial&amp;#8221;.</description>
