      <description>coming out from under a dark cloud.
 my passion has been tested &amp; refined during the past few months,   and i&amp;#8217;m happy to say that i&amp;#8217;m starting to see it again.     and this time, it&amp;#8217;s version 2.0!     i&amp;#8217;ve come to recognize that my core values &amp; strengths were not aligned with my behavior.   my energy was being diffused by activities &amp; investments that were incongruent.</description>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s a birthday party!
 i&amp;#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, &amp; a sick cat,   and today is bob&amp;#8217;s birthday.   but i&amp;#8217;ve managed to make time &amp; create space to embrace this special day.     birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.   they&amp;#8217;re a celebration of life &amp; the uniqueness of each person,   but they can also be times of stress &amp; the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.</description>
