      <description>coming out from under a dark cloud.
my passion has been tested &amp;amp; refined during the past few months,
and i&amp;#8217;m happy to say that i&amp;#8217;m starting to see it again.

i&amp;#8217;ve come to recognize that my core values &amp;amp; strengths were not aligned with my behavior.

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s a birthday party!
i&amp;#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, &amp;amp; a sick cat,
and today is bob&amp;#8217;s birthday.
but i&amp;#8217;ve managed to make time &amp;amp; create space to embrace this special day.
birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.
they&amp;#8217;re a celebration of life &amp;amp; the uniqueness of each person,
but they can also be times of stress &amp;amp; the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.
today, i&amp;#8217;m going easy on myself &amp;amp; bob so we can truly enjoy his day.</description>
