      <description>Once upon a time, people worshiped idols. They were made of wood or clay or stone. They looked like creatures, and they couldn&amp;#8217;t do anything. These ancient people were silly for thinking the idols could help them. Now, we are so much better and smarter, and we don&amp;#8217;t have idols.
This was the story I told myself growing up in the Church.
And then my Sunday school teacher informed me TV could be an idol.</description>
