      <description>we ripped 3 links off the blue paper chain hanging in our bedroom this morning. the chain represents our debt, each link being $1,000.
there was a time in my life when spending $1,000 was an absurd thought. however, i came into this marriage with
$7,000 of debt that i owed on my car + $5,000 remaining on my school loan. ____________ $12,000 in the hole.
add that to what bob had being a homeowner with a mortgage, and our chain was too long for us not to notice it.</description>
