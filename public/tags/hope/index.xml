      <description>it&amp;#8217;s a birthday party!
i&amp;#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, &amp;amp; a sick cat,
and today is bob&amp;#8217;s birthday.
but i&amp;#8217;ve managed to make time &amp;amp; create space to embrace this special day.
birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.
they&amp;#8217;re a celebration of life &amp;amp; the uniqueness of each person,
but they can also be times of stress &amp;amp; the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.
today, i&amp;#8217;m going easy on myself &amp;amp; bob so we can truly enjoy his day.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;m working on a list of passion-blockers.
as i write each one down, i feel a twinge of guilt at how i&amp;#8217;ve let it get to me in the past.
fatigue
denial of ability/passion
fear
resistance
others&amp;#8217; reactions
unrealistic standards
distraction
formalization
and so on&amp;#8230;
my internal conflict comes from my belief that Jesus,
in all His wisdom &amp;amp; love,
has given us all unique passion in each of our lives.</description>

      <title>Introducing: PASH10</title>

      <description>what is PASH10?
i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp;amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.
this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.
that theme is passion.
passion in my marriage, my faith, my relationships, my interests, my work, my studies, my interactions, and just the way i live my life overall.</description>
