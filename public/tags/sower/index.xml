      <description>I recently came across a sort of time capsule that perfectly exemplified where I was at during that point in my spiritual life. Rarely does a time capsule perfectly fulfill what it&amp;#8217;s supposed to do &amp;#8211; make the recipient into a time traveler &amp;#8211; but this one put me squarely in my thought process of 2009 Jessica.
The item was a treatment for an animation I was proposing at that time for my friend, Kristen.</description>
