      <description>“I’m not political,” I said.
“Must be nice,” she replied.
Know what’s weird about this conversation? I don’t remember with whom I was speaking. It has transcended an actual setting and characters. All I recall is that I was in a majority class &amp;#8211; white, Christian, straight, able-bodied, whatever &amp;#8211; and my friend was not.
This simple dialogue has taken place in various ways on more than one occasion, boring itself deeper and deeper into my psyche, each time convicting me that I enjoy privilege I have not earned.</description>

      <description>You know that experience when you&amp;#8217;re so close to something you can&amp;#8217;t really say anything about it? When it&amp;#8217;s feels like you&amp;#8217;re trying to build something and discover you&amp;#8217;re using water instead of packing snow? When you&amp;#8217;re afraid a remark about it would only touch part and miss the whole?
I remember someone joking that if you need the definition of &amp;#8220;psychology&amp;#8221;, you should [counterintuitively] ask the first-semester psych major, not the PhD clinician.</description>

      <description>Dear Shawn,
It has been exactly 10 years since we met. If you hadn&amp;#8217;t left this earth that day in July, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have realized this. I also wouldn&amp;#8217;t find myself tearing up at thoughts of eating toast at a family restaurant, or searching intensely through my CD collection for that scratched-up disc with &amp;#8220;Trudy&amp;#8221; scrawled on it which we found in a parking lot, deciding I absolutely must keep it.</description>

      <description>been reading through 1 thessalonians, &amp;amp; skipping over parts.
 this is amusing to me, as the book is only 4 pages long in the message bible.   however, i found i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with some elements &amp; moved on.     and then i took a moment this morning to ask myself:   why can&amp;#8217;t i relate?   what are those elements?     the answer was this:   i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with the intensity of love that paul expressed toward the thessalonians.</description>
