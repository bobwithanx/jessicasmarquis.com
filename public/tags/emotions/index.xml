      <description>“I’m not political,” I said.
“Must be nice,” she replied.
Know what’s weird about this conversation? I don’t remember with whom I was speaking. It has transcended an actual setting and characters. All I recall is that I was in a majority class &amp;#8211; white, Christian, straight, able-bodied, whatever &amp;#8211; and my friend was not.
This simple dialogue has taken place in various ways on more than one occasion, boring itself deeper and deeper into my psyche, each time convicting me that I enjoy privilege I have not earned.</description>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s been a long, hard week.
lots of driving &amp;amp; busyness,
mixed with trying to settle emotions stirred up by all the activity.
i don&amp;#8217;t tend to be an extremely emotional person,
so enduring emotional upheaval is a true test of patience for me.
but this unsettlement within me allowed me a window into something i rarely examine:
i was able to tune into how i feel about events, behaviors, etc.</description>
