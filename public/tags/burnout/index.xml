      <description>There has been a common underlying theme in several of my conversations recently. I think the title of this post gave it away &amp;#8211; maybe I should have been a bit more sneaky and teased the story better. Next time.
As I was contemplating how prevalent burnout is among women who love to serve in ministry, who are sooooo ready to use their gifts, I realized what a marvelous scam it is for the enemy.</description>

      <description>learning to simplify.
it&amp;#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&amp;#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.
i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &amp;#8212;
if i feel the ache at all.
throughout the past several years, i&amp;#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.
this includes knowing my limits &amp;amp; respecting them,
while also pushing those that have growth potential.
this requires some interesting conditional formatting in my life&amp;#8217;s excel table.</description>
