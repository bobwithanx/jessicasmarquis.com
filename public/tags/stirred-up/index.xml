      <description>this week has been busy &amp;amp; full of life lessons.
i&amp;#8217;ve traveled to &amp;amp; from tucson (soon to be to &amp;amp; from again),
assisted bob in editing our film to submit to a film festival,
attempted to actually get some work done at the office,
and engaged in a work activity that involved downtown PHX &amp;amp; the light rail.
that last one is what i want to really examine right now.</description>

      <title>Introducing: PASH10</title>

      <description>what is PASH10?
i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp;amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.
this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.
that theme is passion.
passion in my marriage, my faith, my relationships, my interests, my work, my studies, my interactions, and just the way i live my life overall.</description>
