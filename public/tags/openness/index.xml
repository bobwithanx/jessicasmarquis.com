      <description>coming out from under a dark cloud.
my passion has been tested &amp;amp; refined during the past few months,
and i&amp;#8217;m happy to say that i&amp;#8217;m starting to see it again.
and this time, it&amp;#8217;s version 2.0!
i&amp;#8217;ve come to recognize that my core values &amp;amp; strengths were not aligned with my behavior.
my energy was being diffused by activities &amp;amp; investments that were incongruent.
so i&amp;#8217;ve taken some time to reacquaint myself with my &amp;#8220;core&amp;#8221;,</description>

      <description>this week has been busy &amp;amp; full of life lessons.
i&amp;#8217;ve traveled to &amp;amp; from tucson (soon to be to &amp;amp; from again),
assisted bob in editing our film to submit to a film festival,
attempted to actually get some work done at the office,
and engaged in a work activity that involved downtown PHX &amp;amp; the light rail.
that last one is what i want to really examine right now.</description>

      <description>learning to simplify.
it&amp;#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&amp;#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.
i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &amp;#8212;
if i feel the ache at all.
throughout the past several years, i&amp;#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.
this includes knowing my limits &amp;amp; respecting them,
while also pushing those that have growth potential.
this requires some interesting conditional formatting in my life&amp;#8217;s excel table.</description>
