      <description>In less than 48 hours, I will be entering a modified Daniel Fast. There is nothing magical about this type of fast; I think it’s just more accessible for many of us. Because I’m still breastfeeding twin boys several times a day, I’m not going to complicate my life by changing this family’s entire diet for 10 days. That would inevitably turn the fast itself into an idol, as I’d scurry about the kitchen picking my brain and the mass brain of the internet for recipes and nutritional considerations.</description>

      <description>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens.~
1 thessalonians 5:16-18
it&amp;#8217;s been a busy/tough past 2 weeks,
at least 4 days of which were spent sprawled on the couch in pain from a toothache.
but there was still joy in the pain, and passion to be celebrated.
the thing i&amp;#8217;m learning this month about passion is that it comes from unexpected places &amp;amp; at unexpected times.</description>
