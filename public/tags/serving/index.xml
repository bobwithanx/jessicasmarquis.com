      <description>here&amp;#8217;s my geek moment of the day: i was looking at the word &amp;#8220;Goals&amp;#8221; &amp;amp; realized that if you put the a &amp;amp; l closer to each other&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;it says &amp;#8220;Gods&amp;#8221;. (which i interpreted to be &amp;#8220;God&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;.)
so here&amp;#8217;s why i allowed that thought to take up more than a nanosecond of my time: i have a tendency to keep things separate. i would set my goals for the day, week, month, year, whatever, and then i&amp;#8217;d think, &amp;#8220;oh, i should really include God somewhere in there.</description>

      <description>the first time someone informed me of what &amp;#8220;dirty rags&amp;#8221; translated to in the Bible, it freaked me out.
and i felt really bad about all i was trying to do.
i was one of those kids who liked to work hard &amp;amp; make others proud.
all-american.
good work ethic.
and then i find out that God doesn&amp;#8217;t care about that stuff.
shoot.
i wanted so badly to win His favor with my smart thinkin&amp;#8217;, elbow grease, &amp;amp; lovableness,</description>

      <title>the foot bath</title>

      <description>i am fascinated by the thought of Jesus washing feet.
regardless of cultural tradition &amp;amp; symbolism, i just love that this Guy cared SO MUCH about the other guys He hung out with that He took on one of the stinkiest parts of the male body.
that is LOVE.
but here&amp;#8217;s the kicker &amp;#8212;
He tells them that He has to wash all their feet to include them in what He was doing.</description>

      <description>it was on my first mission trip at age 14 that i realized that being young could be a useful thing.
somehow, i had picked up on the message that a person could not do something of worth until s/he was an &amp;#8220;adult&amp;#8221;.
seeing the zeal of my peers &amp;amp; the products of our Christ-focused teamwork convinced me:
Jesus really can use people under the age of 18!
what bothers me, though, is that there continues to be evidence of reverse ageism when it comes to leadership in the church.</description>
