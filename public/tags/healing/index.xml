      <description>In all my experience with obeying Christ &amp;#8211; and with disobeying Him &amp;#8211; I have become convinced that when we get serious about following Him, things get harder. Life gets uglier. Obstacles appear out of nowhere, and we wonder if maybe we messed up or maybe it isn&amp;#8217;t worth it to keep going.
This has become all the more true since I&amp;#8217;ve fully committed to the ministry my Shepherd called me into.</description>

      <description>There is a popular anecdote about a kid with anger issues. Here&amp;#8217;s a version of it:
&amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.&amp;nbsp;
The first day the boy had&amp;nbsp; driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down.</description>
