      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about weeds,
particularly the ones in the parable of the sower.
in the first two scenarios the seeds didn&amp;#8217;t really get much of a chance:
birds ate &amp;#8217;em or the sun scorched &amp;#8217;em because they didn&amp;#8217;t really have good roots.
but in the third scenario,
the weeds,
the seeds were able to burrow down &amp;amp; begin to grow.
their success was compromised not by the soil but by the setting.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been working with a friend on creating a film piece on trees.
God really seemed to have an affinity to that metaphor.
we&amp;#8217;re finding that we do, too.
the trees of our Lord are sturdy &amp;amp; dependable,
and they are dependent on Him for life &amp;amp; sustenance.
they don&amp;#8217;t run out of fruit &amp;#8212; ever!
and, gosh, does He ever love &amp;amp; care for them.
we&amp;#8217;re excited to make this piece to share His love of trees with others in His forest.</description>
