      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working hard on CAST #2: Restoration, an event for women focusing on both brokenness &amp;amp; God&amp;#8217;s restorative vision for creation. My personal drama is this: I&amp;#8217;m currently in a complicated relationship with restoration.
As I&amp;#8217;ve previously written, I recently went through a confusingly dry season of waiting &amp;amp; clinging. It&amp;#8217;s been jet-black darkness at countless times, with equally innumerable false-starts of returning to daylight.
All the while, I&amp;#8217;ve been holding to the hope-inflating notion that when I reach daylight there will be a tangible sense of restoration.</description>

      <description>There is a popular anecdote about a kid with anger issues. Here&amp;#8217;s a version of it:
&amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;There once was a little boy who had a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he must hammer a nail into the back of the fence.&amp;nbsp;
The first day the boy had&amp;nbsp; driven 37 nails into the fence. Over the next few weeks, as he learned to control his anger, the number of nails hammered daily gradually dwindled down.</description>
