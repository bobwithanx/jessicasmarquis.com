      <description>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens.~
1 thessalonians 5:16-18
it&amp;#8217;s been a busy/tough past 2 weeks,
at least 4 days of which were spent sprawled on the couch in pain from a toothache.
but there was still joy in the pain, and passion to be celebrated.
the thing i&amp;#8217;m learning this month about passion is that it comes from unexpected places &amp;amp; at unexpected times.</description>

      <description>been reading through 1 thessalonians, &amp;amp; skipping over parts.
this is amusing to me, as the book is only 4 pages long in the message bible.
however, i found i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with some elements &amp;amp; moved on.
and then i took a moment this morning to ask myself:
why can&amp;#8217;t i relate?
what are those elements?
the answer was this:
i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with the intensity of love that paul expressed toward the thessalonians.</description>
