      <description>spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.
this is a passion i&amp;#8217;ve put off for a while.
i&amp;#8217;ve dabbled here &amp;amp; there,
but i wouldn&amp;#8217;t allow myself to dive in.
with bob&amp;#8217;s encouragement, i did it.
it was a huge time &amp;amp; $ commitment,
but it was worth it.
i stretched.
i was uncomfortable.
i was creative.
and now there is no turning back.
to have that kind of opportunity &amp;amp; not do anything with it is ungrateful &amp;amp; unwise.</description>
