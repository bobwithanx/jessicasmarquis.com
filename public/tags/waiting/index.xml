      <description>“I’m not political,” I said.
“Must be nice,” she replied.
Know what’s weird about this conversation? I don’t remember with whom I was speaking. It has transcended an actual setting and characters. All I recall is that I was in a majority class &amp;#8211; white, Christian, straight, able-bodied, whatever &amp;#8211; and my friend was not.
This simple dialogue has taken place in various ways on more than one occasion, boring itself deeper and deeper into my psyche, each time convicting me that I enjoy privilege I have not earned.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working hard on CAST #2: Restoration, an event for women focusing on both brokenness &amp;amp; God&amp;#8217;s restorative vision for creation. My personal drama is this: I&amp;#8217;m currently in a complicated relationship with restoration.
As I&amp;#8217;ve previously written, I recently went through a confusingly dry season of waiting &amp;amp; clinging. It&amp;#8217;s been jet-black darkness at countless times, with equally innumerable false-starts of returning to daylight.
All the while, I&amp;#8217;ve been holding to the hope-inflating notion that when I reach daylight there will be a tangible sense of restoration.</description>
