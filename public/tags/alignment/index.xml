      <description>three-day weekends throw me for a loop.
 when i was younger, a day off meant VACATION!   now, it means having more time for organizing, errand-running, &amp; homework.   my to-do list for today looks nothing like a passion-igniter.     but yesterday&amp;#8217;s message at our church certainly was.     after talking about how our small expectations can get in the way of God actually creating something awesome &amp;#8212;   or, at least, get in the way of us appreciating it   &amp;#8212; pastor john challenged us to consider some questions during reflection time.</description>

      <description>here&amp;#8217;s my geek moment of the day:
i was looking at the word &amp;#8220;Goals&amp;#8221; &amp;amp; realized that if you put the a &amp;amp; l closer to each other&amp;#8230;
&amp;#8230;it says &amp;#8220;Gods&amp;#8221;.
(which i interpreted to be &amp;#8220;God&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;.)
so here&amp;#8217;s why i allowed that thought to take up more than a nanosecond of my time:
i have a tendency to keep things separate.
i would set my goals for the day, week, month, year, whatever,</description>
