      <description>three-day weekends throw me for a loop.
when i was younger, a day off meant VACATION!
now, it means having more time for organizing, errand-running, &amp;amp; homework.
my to-do list for today looks nothing like a passion-igniter.
but yesterday&amp;#8217;s message at our church certainly was.
after talking about how our small expectations can get in the way of God actually creating something awesome &amp;#8212;
or, at least, get in the way of us appreciating it</description>

      <description>here&amp;#8217;s my geek moment of the day: i was looking at the word &amp;#8220;Goals&amp;#8221; &amp;amp; realized that if you put the a &amp;amp; l closer to each other&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;it says &amp;#8220;Gods&amp;#8221;. (which i interpreted to be &amp;#8220;God&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;.)
so here&amp;#8217;s why i allowed that thought to take up more than a nanosecond of my time: i have a tendency to keep things separate. i would set my goals for the day, week, month, year, whatever, and then i&amp;#8217;d think, &amp;#8220;oh, i should really include God somewhere in there.</description>
