      <description>Once upon a time, people worshiped idols. They were made of wood or clay or stone. They looked like creatures, and they couldn&amp;#8217;t do anything. These ancient people were silly for thinking the idols could help them. Now, we are so much better and smarter, and we don&amp;#8217;t have idols.
This was the story I told myself growing up in the Church.
And then my Sunday school teacher informed me TV could be an idol.</description>

      <description>Dear patrons of the local Mexican restaurant my family frequents,
Thank you for allowing my husband and me to argue in your midst. Thank you for averting your eyes and not [audibly] questioning our decision to hash it all out in front of our young children. This has been a long journey for us to get to this place in our marriage, where we can be real with each other and show our disagreements instead of forced pleasantries.</description>
