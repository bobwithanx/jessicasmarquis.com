      <description>You know that experience when you&amp;#8217;re so close to something you can&amp;#8217;t really say anything about it? When it&amp;#8217;s feels like you&amp;#8217;re trying to build something and discover you&amp;#8217;re using water instead of packing snow? When you&amp;#8217;re afraid a remark about it would only touch part and miss the whole?
I remember someone joking that if you need the definition of &amp;#8220;psychology&amp;#8221;, you should [counterintuitively] ask the first-semester psych major, not the PhD clinician.</description>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s tough to keep track of what i depend on.
i have a list of plans:
plan a, plan b, plan c&amp;#8230;
always something to back up the plan preceding it so i don&amp;#8217;t feel &amp;#8220;out of control&amp;#8221;.
but these plans are really only illusions,
and this gets shoved in my face as often as God remembers to show love to me.
He doesn&amp;#8217;t like me depending on anything other than Him,</description>
