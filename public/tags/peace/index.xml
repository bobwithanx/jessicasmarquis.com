      <description>learning to simplify.
 it&amp;#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&amp;#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.   i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &amp;#8212;   if i feel the ache at all.     throughout the past several years, i&amp;#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.   this includes knowing my limits &amp; respecting them,   while also pushing those that have growth potential.</description>

      <description>what is PASH10?
 i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.     this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.     that theme is passion.</description>

      <description>i find it fascinating that this is a season of both
gladness
&amp;amp;
sorrow.
for some, there is gratitude for the gift of life &amp;amp; the opportunity to share all that it means.
for others, there is dread of the stress &amp;amp; sense of inadequacy the commercialized holidays bring out.
for even others, there is a depression that sets in from loss, loneliness, &amp;amp; lethargy.
to reduce/eliminate the holiday blues,</description>
