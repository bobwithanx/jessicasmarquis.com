      <description>learning to simplify.
it&amp;#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&amp;#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.
i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &amp;#8212;
if i feel the ache at all.
throughout the past several years, i&amp;#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.
this includes knowing my limits &amp;amp; respecting them,
while also pushing those that have growth potential.
this requires some interesting conditional formatting in my life&amp;#8217;s excel table.</description>

      <description>what is PASH10?
i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp;amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.
this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.
that theme is passion.
passion in my marriage, my faith, my relationships, my interests, my work, my studies, my interactions, and just the way i live my life overall.</description>

      <description>i find it fascinating that this is a season of both
gladness
&amp;amp;
sorrow.
for some, there is gratitude for the gift of life &amp;amp; the opportunity to share all that it means.
for others, there is dread of the stress &amp;amp; sense of inadequacy the commercialized holidays bring out.
for even others, there is a depression that sets in from loss, loneliness, &amp;amp; lethargy.
to reduce/eliminate the holiday blues,</description>
