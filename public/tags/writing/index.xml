      <description>When I was in middle school, I got the itch to organize events. No, that&amp;#8217;s inaccurate. I realized the need for organization, so I did it. There wasn&amp;#8217;t really an itch, just a desire to get to the end goal and no bridges provided to it. The point is, I got started in event creation and project management shortly after I hit the double digits, so I have a little bit of experience in it.</description>

      <description>spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.
this is a passion i&amp;#8217;ve put off for a while.
i&amp;#8217;ve dabbled here &amp;amp; there,
but i wouldn&amp;#8217;t allow myself to dive in.
with bob&amp;#8217;s encouragement, i did it.
it was a huge time &amp;amp; $ commitment,
but it was worth it.
i stretched.
i was uncomfortable.
i was creative.
and now there is no turning back.
to have that kind of opportunity &amp;amp; not do anything with it is ungrateful &amp;amp; unwise.</description>
