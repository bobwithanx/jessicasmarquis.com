      <description>Last December, we had our front and back yards turned into desert landscaping. They went from being full of dirt, weeds, a big mulberry tree that pigeons pooped from, and a thorny bougainvillea, to being full of rocks, desert plants, a smaller tree that pigeons disdain, and a wispy bush with orange flowers.
We were enamored.
And then the weeds started. They got out of control. We tried to fight them, but we had to have professionals come in.</description>

      <description>I was never much of a clubber. In my late teens and early twenties, I liked going dancing with my friends on occasion, but my dancing was more entertaining than sexy so I didn&amp;#8217;t fit in at many venues. Plus, most of them were smoker friendly back then, and drinks cost a hefty fraction of my paycheck. (There weren&amp;#8217;t many people who wanted to buy a drink for the gal using coffee stirrers as glow sticks during the remix of Ben Folds Five&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Brick&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; which, by the way, whose awful idea was that to create a club version of a tragic abortion song?</description>

      <description>I recently came across a sort of time capsule that perfectly exemplified where I was at during that point in my spiritual life. Rarely does a time capsule perfectly fulfill what it&amp;#8217;s supposed to do &amp;#8211; make the recipient into a time traveler &amp;#8211; but this one put me squarely in my thought process of 2009 Jessica.
The item was a treatment for an animation I was proposing at that time for my friend, Kristen.</description>

      <description>what is PASH10?
i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp;amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.
this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.
that theme is passion.
passion in my marriage, my faith, my relationships, my interests, my work, my studies, my interactions, and just the way i live my life overall.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been thinking a lot about weeds,
particularly the ones in the parable of the sower.
in the first two scenarios the seeds didn&amp;#8217;t really get much of a chance:
birds ate &amp;#8217;em or the sun scorched &amp;#8217;em because they didn&amp;#8217;t really have good roots.
but in the third scenario,
the weeds,
the seeds were able to burrow down &amp;amp; begin to grow.
their success was compromised not by the soil but by the setting.</description>

      <description>gardening isn&amp;#8217;t really my thing.
still, i&amp;#8217;m fascinated by the thought of mulching.
being able to use the refuse of plants to produce new &amp;amp; healthy plants is so ingenious to me.
and as i ponder this,
i realize that my Gardener is in the business of mulching.
because i&amp;#8217;ve got a ton of refuse that i&amp;#8217;ve accumulated from
 poor choices shameful actions skeletons in the closet  and i often don&amp;#8217;t think anything good can come out of that stuff.</description>

      <description>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. this is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.~
1 thessalonians 5:16-18
it isn&amp;#8217;t easy to be grateful all the time.
my default mode is set to &amp;#8220;brood, worry, &amp;amp; complain&amp;#8221;.
switching out of that mode takes considerable effort.
i mention this because i&amp;#8217;ve been working against my default a lot lately.</description>

      <description>my mouth gets me into a lot of trouble.
don&amp;#8217;t get me wrong &amp;#8212;
i TRY to make it do good things.
but sometimes it just seems to have a mind of its own.
in reading ephesians 4, it&amp;#8217;s interesting how many things we are warned against that have to do with our mouths.
even the indirect ones, like being angry, are often expressed through words.
so how do we keep our black holes from sucking us into oblivion?</description>

      <description>the first time someone informed me of what &amp;#8220;dirty rags&amp;#8221; translated to in the Bible, it freaked me out.
and i felt really bad about all i was trying to do.
i was one of those kids who liked to work hard &amp;amp; make others proud.
all-american.
good work ethic.
and then i find out that God doesn&amp;#8217;t care about that stuff.
shoot.
i wanted so badly to win His favor with my smart thinkin&amp;#8217;, elbow grease, &amp;amp; lovableness,</description>

      <description>i don&amp;#8217;t know why i don&amp;#8217;t get it.
i&amp;#8217;ve gone through it multiple times each year,
but i forget the protocol every time.
God gives me a dream.
i get excited.
i started to dream with this dream.
and this is where i go wrong.
i cling to the dream.
God asks for it back.
i tell him i want to figure it out first, that i have some great ideas.</description>

      <description>we&amp;#8217;re 1&amp;frasl;3 of the way through.
33.3333333333333&amp;#8230;%
but that 1&amp;frasl;3 is just when it comes to time, not to the actual goal.
we prayerfully set the goal of raising $80,000 in 90 days.
the purposes of this goal were to help us:
 get focused on the Lord get out of debt get giving to some important causes.  of course, we realize $80,000 isn&amp;#8217;t petty cash.
so we have been working daily to create new opportunities for cash flow &amp;amp; savings.</description>

      <description>i find it funny that i have to ask myself if i want to go deeper with God.
shouldn&amp;#8217;t the answer be an automatic &amp;amp; resounding &amp;#8220;YES!&amp;#8221;?
yet i realize that such a decision creates consequences elsewhere:
going deeper denotes excavation,
and excavation causes other areas to get stirred up &amp;amp; disrupted.
see the helpful flowchart below:
going deeper &amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;gt; knocking my ducks out of a row
i work really hard to get my stuff settled.</description>
