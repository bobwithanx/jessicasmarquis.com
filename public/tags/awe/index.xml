      <description>when i look around at people, i am baffled by the vast array of differences that exist.
sometimes i ask (&amp;amp; have overheard others say),
&amp;#8220;why didn&amp;#8217;t He just make us all alike?&amp;#8221;
and then i see a pack of legos &amp;amp; realize that this is more like how God works.
we are not meant to exist alone.
a solitary lego is of little use other than to hurt a whole lot when you step on it.</description>

      <description>en route to church today, i was caught by a thought: i was getting a chance to immerse myself in a preview of Whom i&amp;#8217;d be worshiping.
much like when i was in high school &amp;amp; would listen to every album of the band i was on my way to see in concert. getting to know their work. getting to appreciate their genius. it put me in the right frame of mind to be in awe.</description>
