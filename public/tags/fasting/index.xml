      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In Dark Night of the Soul, St. John of the Cross exposes a host of attitudes and behaviors we may not realize are sins, as they are borne out of spiritual practices. The one that grabbed my attention today was “spiritual gluttony”. This is where we crave and pursue the sweetness of spiritual mountain-top experiences more than we do our Savior.
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was hitting so close to home that I thought maybe I was misreading it &amp;#8211; putting my own thoughts into the 16-century monk’s head.</description>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In less than 48 hours, I will be entering a modified Daniel Fast. There is nothing magical about this type of fast; I think it’s just more accessible for many of us. Because I’m still breastfeeding twin boys several times a day, I’m not going to complicate my life by changing this family’s entire diet for 10 days. That would inevitably turn the fast itself into an idol, as I’d scurry about the kitchen picking my brain and the mass brain of the internet for recipes and nutritional considerations.</description>
