      <description>In Dark Night of the Soul, St. John of the Cross exposes a host of attitudes and behaviors we may not realize are sins, as they are borne out of spiritual practices. The one that grabbed my attention today was “spiritual gluttony”. This is where we crave and pursue the sweetness of spiritual mountain-top experiences more than we do our Savior.
It was hitting so close to home that I thought maybe I was misreading it &amp;#8211; putting my own thoughts into the 16-century monk’s head.</description>

      <description>Below is a letter I posted at my new blog, Verses 3 to 5, where Christian women can post letters to their former selves. God&amp;#8217;s grace is so good!
Dear 22-year-old Jessy,
First of all, I know how closed you are to advice, especially any that comes from someone who approaches you with an attitude of, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m older, so I know.&amp;#8221; It seems condescending, and I will strive to avoid that here.</description>
