      <description>You know that experience when you&amp;#8217;re so close to something you can&amp;#8217;t really say anything about it? When it&amp;#8217;s feels like you&amp;#8217;re trying to build something and discover you&amp;#8217;re using water instead of packing snow? When you&amp;#8217;re afraid a remark about it would only touch part and miss the whole?
I remember someone joking that if you need the definition of &amp;#8220;psychology&amp;#8221;, you should [counterintuitively] ask the first-semester psych major, not the PhD clinician.</description>

      <description>this week has been busy &amp;amp; full of life lessons.
i&amp;#8217;ve traveled to &amp;amp; from tucson (soon to be to &amp;amp; from again),
assisted bob in editing our film to submit to a film festival,
attempted to actually get some work done at the office,
and engaged in a work activity that involved downtown PHX &amp;amp; the light rail.
that last one is what i want to really examine right now.</description>

      <description>we ripped 3 links off the blue paper chain hanging in our bedroom this morning. the chain represents our debt, each link being $1,000.
there was a time in my life when spending $1,000 was an absurd thought. however, i came into this marriage with
$7,000 of debt that i owed on my car + $5,000 remaining on my school loan. ____________ $12,000 in the hole.
add that to what bob had being a homeowner with a mortgage, and our chain was too long for us not to notice it.</description>

      <description>yesterday, we visited our friends&amp;#8217; church, poiema, one much closer to us than the one we&amp;#8217;ve been attending in north phoenix.
it was odd doing this, as we&amp;#8217;ve been going to PVCC since we moved here, and we&amp;#8217;ve made some great friends there.
still, we were interested in checking out poiema &amp;amp; meeting some new people.
and for those of us who know genesis, our church back in royal oak, you&amp;#8217;d know how at home we felt when we found out the following:</description>
