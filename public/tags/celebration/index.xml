      <description>it&amp;#8217;s a birthday party!
i&amp;#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, &amp;amp; a sick cat,
and today is bob&amp;#8217;s birthday.
but i&amp;#8217;ve managed to make time &amp;amp; create space to embrace this special day.
birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.
they&amp;#8217;re a celebration of life &amp;amp; the uniqueness of each person,
but they can also be times of stress &amp;amp; the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.
today, i&amp;#8217;m going easy on myself &amp;amp; bob so we can truly enjoy his day.</description>

      <description>today is my mom&amp;#8217;s birthday.
she&amp;#8217;s 29 &amp;amp; holding.
if there is anyone in this world who exhibits obvious passion in her life,
it&amp;#8217;s my mom.
mom loves teaching, as well as the kids in her class.
when i call her to catch up, i am always an audience to her stories of their successes or tragedies &amp;#8212;
but most often their successes, since she believes so much in them.</description>
