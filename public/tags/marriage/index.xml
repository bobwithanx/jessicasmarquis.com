      <description>Dear patrons of the local Mexican restaurant my family frequents,
Thank you for allowing my husband and me to argue in your midst. Thank you for averting your eyes and not [audibly] questioning our decision to hash it all out in front of our young children. This has been a long journey for us to get to this place in our marriage, where we can be real with each other and show our disagreements instead of forced pleasantries.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been off the grid, indulging a growing passion:
bob, a team of PHX creatives, &amp;amp; i made a full microshort this weekend.
 we&amp;amp;#8217;ve been making films together since we met: he directs, i write, &amp;amp; we make magic happen. it&amp;amp;#8217;s tough working so closely &amp;amp; intensely sometimes, and we&amp;amp;#8217;ve learned a lot about teamwork through it all. i guess my passion for making films goes hand-in-hand with my passion for my marriage.</description>
