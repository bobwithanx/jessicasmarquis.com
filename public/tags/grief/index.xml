      <description>We are currently church orphans. I guess that term is preferable to church shoppers, and it feels more emotionally appropriate because we left our church after discovering it was moving in a different direction from us. To be blunt, it felt like it had already left us, and we had just received the news.
This post isn&amp;#8217;t about our former church. We love our family there and the work they are doing in the name of our Savior in the city and world.</description>

      <description>“I’m not political,” I said.
“Must be nice,” she replied.
Know what’s weird about this conversation? I don’t remember with whom I was speaking. It has transcended an actual setting and characters. All I recall is that I was in a majority class &amp;#8211; white, Christian, straight, able-bodied, whatever &amp;#8211; and my friend was not.
This simple dialogue has taken place in various ways on more than one occasion, boring itself deeper and deeper into my psyche, each time convicting me that I enjoy privilege I have not earned.</description>

      <description>Last December, we had our front and back yards turned into desert landscaping. They went from being full of dirt, weeds, a big mulberry tree that pigeons pooped from, and a thorny bougainvillea, to being full of rocks, desert plants, a smaller tree that pigeons disdain, and a wispy bush with orange flowers.
We were enamored.
And then the weeds started. They got out of control. We tried to fight them, but we had to have professionals come in.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m working hard on CAST #2: Restoration, an event for women focusing on both brokenness &amp;amp; God&amp;#8217;s restorative vision for creation. My personal drama is this: I&amp;#8217;m currently in a complicated relationship with restoration.
As I&amp;#8217;ve previously written, I recently went through a confusingly dry season of waiting &amp;amp; clinging. It&amp;#8217;s been jet-black darkness at countless times, with equally innumerable false-starts of returning to daylight.
All the while, I&amp;#8217;ve been holding to the hope-inflating notion that when I reach daylight there will be a tangible sense of restoration.</description>

      <description>I mentioned in an earlier post that I may do a &amp;#8220;snowflake vigil&amp;#8221; with my kiddos, all under age 4, regarding the tragic mass shooting at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando. It&amp;#8217;s critical to start an ongoing conversation with them even now about loving others, respecting all, and advocacy. If we claim to love Jesus, whose heart was all about justice, we need to also claim verses like this one: _ _</description>

      <description>Sadness isn&amp;#8217;t an easy feeling for us. Anger is easy because it&amp;#8217;s in motion. It helps us feel like we&amp;#8217;re doing something. But sadness has a purpose &amp;#8211; if nothing else, &amp;#8216;Inside Out&amp;#8217; should have taught us that.
Yes, we need to be angry about what happened yesterday in Orlando. I&amp;#8217;m pissed like a bee-stung mama bear that anyone would so brutally harm my fellow beloved creations of God, that my LGBTQ brothers &amp;amp; sisters yet again feel victimized.</description>

      <description>Dear Shawn,
It has been exactly 10 years since we met. If you hadn&amp;#8217;t left this earth that day in July, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have realized this. I also wouldn&amp;#8217;t find myself tearing up at thoughts of eating toast at a family restaurant, or searching intensely through my CD collection for that scratched-up disc with &amp;#8220;Trudy&amp;#8221; scrawled on it which we found in a parking lot, deciding I absolutely must keep it.</description>
