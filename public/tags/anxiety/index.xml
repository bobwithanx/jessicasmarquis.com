      <description>“I’m not political,” I said.
“Must be nice,” she replied.
Know what’s weird about this conversation? I don’t remember with whom I was speaking. It has transcended an actual setting and characters. All I recall is that I was in a majority class &amp;#8211; white, Christian, straight, able-bodied, whatever &amp;#8211; and my friend was not.
This simple dialogue has taken place in various ways on more than one occasion, boring itself deeper and deeper into my psyche, each time convicting me that I enjoy privilege I have not earned.</description>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s a birthday party!
i&amp;#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, &amp;amp; a sick cat,
and today is bob&amp;#8217;s birthday.
but i&amp;#8217;ve managed to make time &amp;amp; create space to embrace this special day.
birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.
they&amp;#8217;re a celebration of life &amp;amp; the uniqueness of each person,
but they can also be times of stress &amp;amp; the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.
today, i&amp;#8217;m going easy on myself &amp;amp; bob so we can truly enjoy his day.</description>
