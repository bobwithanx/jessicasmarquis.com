      <description>We recently instituted a ban on the word &amp;#8220;poop&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; and all its variants &amp;#8211; while eating meals. Naturally, our oldest had lots of questions to determine loopholes, because that is what she does. She&amp;#8217;s a negotiator, and even at age 5 she wants to determine all the gray areas. She&amp;#8217;s already learned that a rule can be bent or circumvented.
Since Bob and I do not have unlimited reserves of patience and creativity, we issued a plain statement that any use of the word would land the speaker in her/his room for a time out.</description>

      <description>For those of you who have set a boundary with a loved one and need a way to communicate about it to your young children, feel free to use the story below which I wrote for our little ones. Due to the tragic passing of my brother after his battle with addiction, we no longer need it; still, I want to share it with anyone who may.
