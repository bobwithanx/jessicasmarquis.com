      <description>this week has been busy &amp;amp; full of life lessons.
i&amp;#8217;ve traveled to &amp;amp; from tucson (soon to be to &amp;amp; from again),
assisted bob in editing our film to submit to a film festival,
attempted to actually get some work done at the office,
and engaged in a work activity that involved downtown PHX &amp;amp; the light rail.
that last one is what i want to really examine right now.</description>

      <description>i decided to inconvenience myself today.
being someone who arranges grocery bags so everything can get carried in on one trip,
plots out maps so all errands can be run in one linear course,
and arranges my schedule to make room for surprises,
i don&amp;#8217;t allow space for inconvenience.
so i suppose i was due some.
the call came as i prepared to tackle a new data analysis project:
i was needed to assist with proctoring an exam.</description>

      <description>i just wanted to buy some mascara.
 i had researched it for months in relation to my preferred mascara brand of several years, the green clinique tube i&amp;amp;#8217;ve perpetually used beyond the recommended 4 months. and as i sat in the chair receiving my impromptu 15-minute makeover,  i thought how comparatively impulsive it was for me to agree to this.
the artist, a friendly woman named debbie, worked quickly as she informed me about the various products coating my face &amp;amp; eyes.</description>

      <description>much of my thinking takes place in the car. i can already predict that &amp;#8212; should a pie chart be made of the topics this blog discusses this year &amp;#8212; a mention of car drives will be a sizable &amp;amp; tasty slice.
as i drove to work yesterday, i found myself really listening to the lyrics on KLove. i saw drivers &amp;amp; landscape around me. colors were vibrant &amp;amp; organic.</description>

      <description>yesterday, we visited our friends&amp;#8217; church, poiema, one much closer to us than the one we&amp;#8217;ve been attending in north phoenix.
it was odd doing this, as we&amp;#8217;ve been going to PVCC since we moved here, and we&amp;#8217;ve made some great friends there.
still, we were interested in checking out poiema &amp;amp; meeting some new people.
and for those of us who know genesis, our church back in royal oak, you&amp;#8217;d know how at home we felt when we found out the following:</description>

      <description>i awoke today refreshed &amp;amp; excited to get started on the next 52 weeks. first question to myself: &amp;#8220;how can i be more passionate today?&amp;#8221;
and i found this is harder to answer than i thought. great idea, frustratingly nebulous execution.
so i&amp;#8217;m trying something i don&amp;#8217;t usually do, just to stir things up.
i&amp;#8217;m listing 5 things i&amp;#8217;m grateful for this morning.
 sunshine, bright &amp;amp; warm with a promise of high 60-degree temps today.</description>
