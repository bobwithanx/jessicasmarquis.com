      <description>Dear Bride of Christ,
I love you with a relentless passion that I can&amp;#8217;t abandon no matter how ugly or derisive you become. You are the creation and beloved of my Beloved, and so I am inseparably part of you. So, since I can&amp;#8217;t leave (which is what I&amp;#8217;m best trained in doing), I need to have a literal &amp;#8220;Come to Jesus&amp;#8221; chat with you.
You &amp;#8211; we &amp;#8211; have forgotten our First Love.</description>

      <description>I was never much of a clubber. In my late teens and early twenties, I liked going dancing with my friends on occasion, but my dancing was more entertaining than sexy so I didn&amp;#8217;t fit in at many venues. Plus, most of them were smoker friendly back then, and drinks cost a hefty fraction of my paycheck. (There weren&amp;#8217;t many people who wanted to buy a drink for the gal using coffee stirrers as glow sticks during the remix of Ben Folds Five&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Brick&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; which, by the way, whose awful idea was that to create a club version of a tragic abortion song?</description>

      <description>been reading through 1 thessalonians, &amp;amp; skipping over parts.
this is amusing to me, as the book is only 4 pages long in the message bible.
however, i found i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with some elements &amp;amp; moved on.
and then i took a moment this morning to ask myself:
why can&amp;#8217;t i relate?
what are those elements?
the answer was this:
i couldn&amp;#8217;t relate with the intensity of love that paul expressed toward the thessalonians.</description>

      <title>leaning on that which stands on its own</title>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s tough to keep track of what i depend on.
i have a list of plans:
plan a, plan b, plan c&amp;#8230;
always something to back up the plan preceding it so i don&amp;#8217;t feel &amp;#8220;out of control&amp;#8221;.
but these plans are really only illusions,
and this gets shoved in my face as often as God remembers to show love to me.
He doesn&amp;#8217;t like me depending on anything other than Him,</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;ve been working with a friend on creating a film piece on trees.
God really seemed to have an affinity to that metaphor.
we&amp;#8217;re finding that we do, too.
the trees of our Lord are sturdy &amp;amp; dependable,
and they are dependent on Him for life &amp;amp; sustenance.
they don&amp;#8217;t run out of fruit &amp;#8212; ever!
and, gosh, does He ever love &amp;amp; care for them.
we&amp;#8217;re excited to make this piece to share His love of trees with others in His forest.</description>

      <description>know what&amp;#8217;s great about God?
He doesn&amp;#8217;t expect superhumanism.
when He says to get along with others, it&amp;#8217;s always framed in a reasonable manner.
He tells us to take breaks &amp;amp; get rest.
and He only tells us to be peacemakers, not peacekeepers.
i like following a proactive, reasonable, caring Deity.
it makes me want to love Him back.
and keep working at doing what He says,
knowing He&amp;#8217;ll accept me regardless of my imperfections.</description>
