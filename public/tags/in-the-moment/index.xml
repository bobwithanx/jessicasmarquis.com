      <description>i just wanted to buy some mascara.
 i had researched it for months in relation to my preferred mascara brand of several years, the green clinique tube i&amp;amp;#8217;ve perpetually used beyond the recommended 4 months. and as i sat in the chair receiving my impromptu 15-minute makeover,  i thought how comparatively impulsive it was for me to agree to this.
the artist, a friendly woman named debbie, worked quickly as she informed me about the various products coating my face &amp;amp; eyes.</description>

      <description>much of my thinking takes place in the car. i can already predict that &amp;#8212; should a pie chart be made of the topics this blog discusses this year &amp;#8212; a mention of car drives will be a sizable &amp;amp; tasty slice.
as i drove to work yesterday, i found myself really listening to the lyrics on KLove. i saw drivers &amp;amp; landscape around me. colors were vibrant &amp;amp; organic.</description>
