      <h1>the dirty rag problem</h1>
    </header>

    <p>the first time someone informed me of what &#8220;dirty rags&#8221; translated to in the Bible, it freaked me out.<br />
and i felt really bad about all i was trying to do.<br />
i was one of those kids who liked to work hard &amp; make others proud.<br />
all-american.<br />
good work ethic.</p>

<p>and then i find out that God doesn&#8217;t care about that stuff.</p>

<p>shoot.</p>

<p>i wanted so badly to win His favor with my smart thinkin&#8217;, elbow grease, &amp; lovableness,<br />
but i come find out He just wanted me to LET GO of my need to earn His favor.<br />
because i already have it.</p>

<p>but how could that be?<br />
and why was it that when i DID try to win Him over things got all the more difficult?</p>

<p>it&#8217;s taken me a lot of tries &#8212;<br />
probably in the triple digits by now &#8212;<br />
to not try.</p>

<p>today, i caught myself coming up with yet another plan to make God like me &amp; make myself more usable for Him.<br />
the dirty rags were piling up.<br />
yet He&#8217;s so patient, isn&#8217;t He?</p>

<p>my prayer is that i let go of my need to act &amp; earn,<br />
and that i let my loving God direct me into the work He has for me.<br />
that i act in His guidance &amp; grace, not my own drive.</p>

<p>at some point, i gotta admit it:<br />
i&#8217;m no good when i go in with my own agenda.<br />
i guess i might as well make that confession today.</p>
