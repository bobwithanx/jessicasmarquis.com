when i look around at people, i am baffled by the vast array of differences that exist.  
sometimes i ask (& have overheard others say),  
&#8220;why didn&#8217;t He just make us all alike?&#8221;  
and then i see a pack of legos & realize that this is more like how God works.

we are not meant to exist alone.  
a solitary lego is of little use other than to hurt a whole lot when you step on it.  
but blend it with other colors, shapes, sizes,  
and you get a colorful house or a pirate ship or a whole new imaginative construct.  
solitary legos just can&#8217;t get that far.

next time you decide it&#8217;s time to just go it alone or find someone exactly like you to work with,  
remember that the end result will be a lot less dynamic & effective.  
we need the different strengths & perspectives that others bring.  
that was in our Lord&#8217;s lego blueprints, after all.

~independence? that is middle-class blasphemy. we are all dependent on one another, every soul of us on earth.~
