If you find yourself saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m a bad mom,&#8221; or even thinking it, those words are _not_ from God. He doesn&#8217;t label us & send us off to pasture; He loves us where we are & helps us grow from there. He is a loving Daddy who wants us to serve Him in our work & take pleasure in it! 

Would you want your child to build a tower then declare, &#8220;I&#8217;m a terrible builder!&#8221;? It would break your heart. And as a parent, it wounds our Creator&#8217;s heart as well to hear us condemn our efforts! God wants our words to speak life &#8211; even about ourselves.
