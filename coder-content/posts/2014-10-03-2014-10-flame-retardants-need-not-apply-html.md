~Don’t burn out; keep yourselves fueled and aflame. Be alert servants of the Master, cheerfully expectant. Don’t quit in hard times; pray all the harder. Help needy Christians; be inventive in hospitality.~  
Romans 12:11-13

What does all this point to? Regular rest, self-care, & quiet time in the King&#8217;s presence. If you aren&#8217;t making time for these, humbly cry out to Daddy, the Creator of time, and He will guide you into R&R so you can truly worship & serve with a fresh filling of the Spirit. Burnt-out, grumpy servants are no pleasure to Him, no matter how much work we accomplish.
