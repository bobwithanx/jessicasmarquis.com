On a personal note, I had twins yesterday. The two boys join their daddy & sister in our wacky home. Off to cocoon for a few hours & bask in this double joy&#8230;

~A woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come; but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world.~
  
John 16:21
