i&#8217;m working on a list of passion-blockers.

  as i write each one down, i feel a twinge of guilt at how i&#8217;ve let it get to me in the past.


  fatigue

  denial of ability/passion

  fear

  resistance

  others&#8217; reactions

  unrealistic standards

  distraction

  formalization

  and so on&#8230;


  my internal conflict comes from my belief that Jesus,

  in all His wisdom & love,

  has given us all unique passion in each of our lives.

  however, we busy ourselves & bury the passion,

  missing a key & pivotal opportunity in our lives to experience that personal gift!


  as i look over this emerging list of passion-blockers, my guilt is that i&#8217;ve let these take over when i could be letting passion into the mix.


  but it doesn&#8217;t have to end there.

  <i>guilt motivates; shame incapacitates.</i>

  i won&#8217;t let this turn to shame.

  i&#8217;ll let the guilt motivate me to bust down some of those passion-blockers.


  the best antidote to passion-blockers is action.

  simply making movement rather than letting them paralyze reduces much of their power.

  today, when a passion-blocker shows up on the scene,

  i&#8217;m starting a lively argument against it & taking action.


  it&#8217;s better than sitting still & feeling guilty forever.
