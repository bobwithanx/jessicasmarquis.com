~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens.~

  1 thessalonians 5:16-18


  it&#8217;s been a busy/tough past 2 weeks,

  at least 4 days of which were spent sprawled on the couch in pain from a toothache.

  but there was still joy in the pain, and passion to be celebrated.


  the thing i&#8217;m learning this month about passion is that it comes from unexpected places & at unexpected times.

  passion doesn&#8217;t like to be predictable or controlled.

  and it doesn&#8217;t like to be ignored.

  ignoring & not appreciating it causes it to go in search of another.


  that was why the verses at the start of this entry appealed to me.

  they&#8217;re an invitation to gratitude even when things seems off/odd/wrong.

  i&#8217;m coming to recognize that it&#8217;s when things are o/o/w that passion is a breath away.

  that unpredictable, uncontrollable creativity is being dislodged.


  today, i&#8217;m appreciative of the interruption that breaks my routine,

  the uncomfortable challenge that introduces me to new people,

  the rote homework assignment that goes tangential into a new area of discovery.


  today, i am praying to be perpetually, sincerely thankful.
