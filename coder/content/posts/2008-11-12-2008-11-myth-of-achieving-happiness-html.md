when i would ask my clients what they wished to accomplish through therapy,  
many shrugged & said half-jokingly,  
&#8220;to be happy.&#8221;  
it was hard to share in the joke;  
happiness doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to creating a clinical treatment plan.

this is why:  
happiness is a byproduct of other things, not an end result in itself.

people want it, but we cannot achieve it if it&#8217;s what we&#8217;re pursuing.

i heard a pastor on the radio yesterday remind us of what we should pursue:  
a life of gratefulness.  
giving thanks at all times,  
not just in the good ones.

if we are followers of Jesus,   
our lives should show a steady stream of thanksgiving.  
bitterness & complaining are not becoming characteristics for His kids.

sure, there are times when things suck,  
just like i mentioned a few posts ago.  
and we don&#8217;t have to pretend that everything is rosy when it isn&#8217;t.  
God didn&#8217;t ask us to be blind, naive, or inept.  
but as we pray on our circumstances let&#8217;s give thanks for what IS working right now & what may come as a result of tough times.

happiness will escape our grasp when we reach for it,  
but thankfulness leads us into joy & peace by its very nature.
