en route to church today, i was caught by a thought:
i was getting a chance to immerse myself in a preview of Whom i&#8217;d be worshiping.

much like when i was in high school & would listen to every album of the band i was on my way to see in concert.
getting to know their work.
getting to appreciate their genius.
it put me in the right frame of mind to be in awe.

the mountains, the sky, the people driving next to me.
all were pointing me toward the Headline Performer.
