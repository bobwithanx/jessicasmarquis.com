Fasting. There, I said it.

A lot of you are facing some difficult, even impossible, situations. Prayer is essential! And I also want to encourage you to consider fasting to allow the Spirit greater access to break down those extra-stubborn strongholds of the enemy.

Maybe you can&#8217;t do a day of fasting from food, but you can forgo one meal & use those hunger pains to remind you of your dependence on the Redeemer & Healer. Maybe you can&#8217;t do without food because you&#8217;re EBF&#8217;ing or diabetic, but you can go without Facebook for 24 hours. Let the Spirit meet your needs as you go deeper than ever in focused prayer to the One who can do more than you can dream!

Remember, Jesus didn&#8217;t say _if_ you fast, but _when_ you fast (Matthew 6:16). I&#8217;m not an expert on this topic, but I have seen the tremendous work God can do in us & others when we obey this instruction!

~&#8221;But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.&#8221;~  
Matthew 17:21
