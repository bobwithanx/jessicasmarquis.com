have you rested today? even if it&#8217;s only for 3 minutes, do it with your whole heart for those 3 minutes. it honors God!&nbsp; (colossians 3:23) plus, when we intentionally create space in our days to rest, God can use that space to take us deeper & give us His limitless peace. it&#8217;s like making a deposit in a savings account with 1000% rates!
