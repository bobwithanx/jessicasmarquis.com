We brag about our kiddos because we spend so much time with them, feeling their love, enjoying their uniqueness. This is what happens when we genuinely engage. If our words & attitudes don&#8217;t reflect this kind of affection for our loving Daddy, it&#8217;s time for us to take some dedicated time alone to genuinely engage with Him! So listen to the birds, read a Psalm, and bask in His gentle & unconditional grace today.
