    </header>

    <p>I&#8217;m working hard on <a href="http://milkweedministries.com/#events" target="_blank">CAST #2: Restoration</a>, an event for women focusing on both brokenness &amp; God&#8217;s restorative vision for creation. My personal drama is this: <strong>I&#8217;m currently in a complicated relationship with restoration.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://www.jessicasmarquis.com/cottonwoodblessings/2016/05/of-obstacles-and-birdsongs.html" target="_blank">previously written</a>, I recently went through a confusingly dry season of waiting &amp; clinging.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been jet-black darkness at countless times, with equally innumerable false-starts of returning to daylight.</p>

<p>All the while, I&#8217;ve been holding to the hope-inflating notion that when I reach daylight there will be a tangible sense of restoration. I&#8217;m not expecting much, just the emotional equivalent of a homecoming parade. And maybe some fireworks, the kind that create shimmering hearts inside of circles and change colors.</p>

<p>But now that I appear to be standing in the sunshine again &#8211; grief, health issues, sleep deprivation, and family concerns relatively resolved &#8211; I still feel residual numbness. And not that tingly-numbness that your foot does to say, &#8220;Okay, okay, I&#8217;m waking up!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Just basic, anticlimactic numbness.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My counseling background keeps tapping me on the shoulder with, &#8220;Well, you know, you&#8217;ve been through some trauma recently,&#8221; and, &#8220;Hey, grief takes many forms.&#8221; All that is true, and I have been giving myself heaping shovelfuls of grace daily.</p>

<p>But shouldn&#8217;t there be <em>some</em> kind of surge of joy upon reentry into the land of the living? Couldn&#8217;t there at least be a small float or one marching band?</p>

<p>I waited on the Lord, Isaiah, so where are the eagle wings and superhuman running capabilities you talked about in Chapter 40, verse 31?</p>

<p>Then again&#8230;could it be that I am mixing up restoration with resolution? Because, come to think of it, I know a lot of folks who have seen an end to the storms in their lives, but still no rainbow.</p>

<p>If that is the case, how do we summon the rainbow?</p>

<p>Until the answer comes, you can find me sitting in gratitude in this new sunlight. Because, irrespective of the numbness, I am deeply grateful to be out of that darkness. And so I will choose to praise even when I don&#8217;t feel it.</p>
