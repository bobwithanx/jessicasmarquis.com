      <h1>Milkweed Turns 1 Year Old, Isn’t Moldy Yet</h1>
    </header>

    <p>It&#8217;s hard to believe my Milkweed family of mamas has been meeting online &amp; in person for over a year! What a tremendous community our loving Daddy has brought together here to pray, encourage, laugh, challenge, &amp; grow.</p>

<p>Some have asked how this group started, and I thought I&#8217;d be a bit transparent here. Last year, my marriage was going through some really hard stuff. I was desperate for other ladies to pray with me, lift me up, hold me accountable, speak truth to me, but I realized how spiritually isolated I had become as a stay-at-home mama. As usual, though, God had something beautiful to pull out of that manure, and He put this challenge on my heart:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;There are other mamas like you out there who are hurting, lonely, or just in need of others to walk beside them honestly &amp; humbly in this journey. They, too, struggle to find a place where they &#8211; &amp; their kiddos &#8211; can fit. It&#8217;s time for community.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Around this time, I visited the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix &amp; learned about milkweed, the plant that monarch butterflies live in &amp; live off of. It houses &amp; nourishes these butterflies, and it makes them poisonous to predators. That is what Godly community, prayer, &amp; Bible study does! And so, our group Milkweed was born, out of the manure of pain &amp; confusion &amp; isolation. I don&#8217;t think I knew anyone at our first meeting, yet it was amazing how open &amp; supportive they all were with one another from that day &amp; all those since. What a life-changing adventure!</p>

<p>Of course, this story isn&#8217;t about me. This is God&#8217;s story. He is the Protagonist, the Narrator, the Editor. He is the Gardener, the Grafter, the Vinekeeper. And I&#8217;m so grateful to be with these ladies in this mess of life, this Milkweed, that He has used to strengthen our marriages, heal our hearts, &amp; lay foundations for Jesus-loving kiddos! All praise be to Him for this year &amp; those to come!</p>

<p>~Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. For if they fall, one will lift up [her] fellow. But woe to [her] who is alone when [she] falls and has not another to lift [her] up!~<br />
Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</p>
