      <h1>Fits and starts</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am no stranger to inconsistency. I know how to start a project with passion and drive&#8230;and never finish it. I have a spotty history of coming and going in friendships and commitments. And, as a native Detroiter, I have weathered the vacillating reputations of the Pistons and the Tigers (although the Lions have been fairly consistent through the years).</p>

<p>And then something happened.</p>

<p>Namely, The Message version of Ephesians 4:2:</p>

<p>~And mark that you do this with humility and discipline—not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love&#8230;~</p>

<p>&#8220;Fits and starts&#8230;&#8221; Oh man, I did not need to finish reading that passage. The phrase had me pegged, and it felt awful. No matter how well I&#8217;d tried to hide it &#8211; no matter how successful I&#8217;d been at doing so &#8211; I knew I was living inconsistently. And my consistent, unchanging God longed to get me on track and in rhythm.</p>

<p>As I read further in the chapter, Ephesians 4:14 (this time, the NIV) nailed me again:</p>

<p>~Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves,</p>

<p>and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning</p>

<p>and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.~</p>

<p>&#8220;Tossed back and forth&#8230;&#8221; Yep, guilty again. I was an immature threenager who just wanted new new new! I loved me some new trends, new insights, new voices. But this thirst for novelty was causing me to wander away from the solidness of The Truth.</p>

<p>And so I relinquished my fits and starts in favor of the seeming boringness of consistency. It took a lot of practice and some embarrassing accountability, but my loving Daddy finally has me on the right path. I&#8217;m still not always great at it &#8211; my personality type is not known for its conventionality &#8211; but God&#8217;s grace covers my flaws.</p>

<p>And Ephesians 4:2, after punching me in the gut, taught me to stay humble as I learn this life of discipline.</p>
