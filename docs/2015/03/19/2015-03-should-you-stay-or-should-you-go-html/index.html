      <h1>Should You Stay or Should You Go?</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Okay, this one may hurt. Loving Daddy, let any wounds that result be trusted as those of a friend (Proverbs 27:6) &amp; as those of Your truth.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, we were discussing in Milkweed our theme verse/passage for 2015. Mine is justice, specifically as it relates to the &#8220;fast&#8221; described in Isaiah 58:6-12. As I&#8217;ve been meditating on this, the Spirit has been redefining my perception of oppression &amp; justice: It&#8217;s not just about slavery, the homeless, minorities, &amp; other headlines in the news, although all of those require us to take action &amp; show love.<br />
In particular, the oppression &amp; justice I am becoming personally aware of is in our relationship with money. One area this is especially evident to us as moms is in our perspective on working for a paycheck.</p>

<p>When I was about to go on maternity leave, my coworkers were certain I would return. As one pointed out to me, &#8220;There is no way these days to raise a family on one income.&#8221; Know what is missing in that statement? Faith. Or, more specifically, our Provider. And yet, so many of us live our lives as though this is an area He somehow lost control over. As soon as things get tight &amp; the checks may start bouncing, we &#8211; and I&#8217;ve done this too! &#8211; immediately start browsing Indeed.com or checking for gigs on Craigslist.</p>

<p>What few of us do <em>first</em> is be still &amp; ask Daddy what He wants out of this time of scarcity. Is it a chance for complete dependence on Him, an opportunity to see His faithfulness in tangible ways, through the sacrifice of our [false] sense of control? Or does He truly want us to return to the workforce at this time, to contribute financially to our family&#8217;s bottom line? He has created you &amp; has a plan for you. For some of us, that means working; for others, that means staying at home. But we must not get His long-term plan confused with our short-term circumstances, no matter how anxiety-inducing they may be.</p>

<p>So, how will we know if we&#8217;re in His plan? If there is Divine peace in our decision. (FYI: He provides for the working mama &amp; the SAHM alike!)</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re facing this quandary, I don&#8217;t know the answer for you. I <em>do</em> know you need to be asking God what He wants &amp; listening for His answer. It&#8217;s easy to try to solve the problem through our own common sense &amp; elbow grease, but if He wants you at home with your kiddo(s) and you&#8217;re making a paycheck or sitting in a classroom, your role as both mom &amp; His daughter will be impacted&#8230;as will your children &amp; your marriage.</p>

<p>The Spirit can set you free to have a fruitful relationship with &amp; healthy perspective on money. What you give your kiddos, your partners, &amp; the Lord will be returned to you &amp; then some &#8211; as long as it is given in obedience &amp; faith.</p>

<p>~Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.~<br />
Luke 6:38</p>
