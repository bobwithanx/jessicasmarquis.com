      <description>spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.
 this is a passion i&amp;#8217;ve put off for a while.   i&amp;#8217;ve dabbled here &amp; there,   but i wouldn&amp;#8217;t allow myself to dive in.     with bob&amp;#8217;s encouragement, i did it.   it was a huge time &amp; $ commitment,   but it was worth it.     i stretched.   i was uncomfortable.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;m working on a list of passion-blockers.
 as i write each one down, i feel a twinge of guilt at how i&amp;#8217;ve let it get to me in the past.     fatigue   denial of ability/passion   fear   resistance   others&amp;#8217; reactions   unrealistic standards   distraction   formalization   and so on&amp;#8230;     my internal conflict comes from my belief that Jesus,   in all His wisdom &amp; love,   has given us all unique passion in each of our lives.</description>
