      <description>today is my mom&amp;#8217;s birthday.
 she&amp;#8217;s 29 &amp; holding.   if there is anyone in this world who exhibits obvious passion in her life,   it&amp;#8217;s my mom.     mom loves teaching, as well as the kids in her class.   when i call her to catch up, i am always an audience to her stories of their successes or tragedies &amp;#8212;   but most often their successes, since she believes so much in them.</description>
