      <description>Lesson I&amp;#8217;ve witnessed over and over: It may seem the same to you, but don&amp;#8217;t assume you know what the other person is feeling. Doing so is like a slap to the face.
Here is the Hierarchy of Face Slaps that tend to commence once someone has made that assumption:
 They say, &amp;#8220;I know what you&amp;#8217;re feeling.&amp;#8221;
 They hijack the conversation to share their story.</description>

      <description>it&amp;#8217;s been a long, hard week.
 lots of driving &amp; busyness,   mixed with trying to settle emotions stirred up by all the activity.   i don&amp;#8217;t tend to be an extremely emotional person,   so enduring emotional upheaval is a true test of patience for me.     but this unsettlement within me allowed me a window into something i rarely examine:   i was able to tune into how i feel about events, behaviors, etc.</description>
