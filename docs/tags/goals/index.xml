      <description>When I was in middle school, I got the itch to organize events. No, that&amp;#8217;s inaccurate. I realized the need for organization, so I did it. There wasn&amp;#8217;t really an itch, just a desire to get to the end goal and no bridges provided to it. The point is, I got started in event creation and project management shortly after I hit the double digits, so I have a little bit of experience in it.</description>

      <description>here&amp;#8217;s my geek moment of the day: i was looking at the word &amp;#8220;Goals&amp;#8221; &amp;amp; realized that if you put the a &amp;amp; l closer to each other&amp;#8230; &amp;#8230;it says &amp;#8220;Gods&amp;#8221;. (which i interpreted to be &amp;#8220;God&amp;#8217;s&amp;#8221;.)
so here&amp;#8217;s why i allowed that thought to take up more than a nanosecond of my time: i have a tendency to keep things separate. i would set my goals for the day, week, month, year, whatever, and then i&amp;#8217;d think, &amp;#8220;oh, i should really include God somewhere in there.</description>
