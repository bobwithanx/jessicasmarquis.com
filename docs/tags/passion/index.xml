      <description>You know that experience when you&amp;#8217;re so close to something you can&amp;#8217;t really say anything about it? When it&amp;#8217;s feels like you&amp;#8217;re trying to build something and discover you&amp;#8217;re using water instead of packing snow? When you&amp;#8217;re afraid a remark about it would only touch part and miss the whole?
I remember someone joking that if you need the definition of &amp;#8220;psychology&amp;#8221;, you should [counterintuitively] ask the first-semester psych major, not the PhD clinician.</description>

      <description>what is PASH10?
i realized that, while i&amp;#8217;m good at setting goals &amp;#8212; and, often, at meeting them &amp;#8212; i haven&amp;#8217;t demonstrated a proficiency in thematic goals. it seems many of my goals are short-sighted &amp;amp; don&amp;#8217;t adhere to a greater strategy.
this year, i named a theme of what i would like to develop in my life over the coming 365 days.
that theme is passion.
passion in my marriage, my faith, my relationships, my interests, my work, my studies, my interactions, and just the way i live my life overall.</description>
