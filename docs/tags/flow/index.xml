      <description>learning to simplify.
it&amp;#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&amp;#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.
i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &amp;#8212;
if i feel the ache at all.
throughout the past several years, i&amp;#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.
this includes knowing my limits &amp;amp; respecting them,
while also pushing those that have growth potential.
this requires some interesting conditional formatting in my life&amp;#8217;s excel table.</description>

      <description>i&amp;#8217;m working on a list of passion-blockers.
as i write each one down, i feel a twinge of guilt at how i&amp;#8217;ve let it get to me in the past.
fatigue
denial of ability/passion
fear
resistance
others&amp;#8217; reactions
unrealistic standards
distraction
formalization
and so on&amp;#8230;
my internal conflict comes from my belief that Jesus,
in all His wisdom &amp;amp; love,
has given us all unique passion in each of our lives.</description>
