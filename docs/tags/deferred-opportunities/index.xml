      <description>spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.
 this is a passion i&amp;#8217;ve put off for a while.   i&amp;#8217;ve dabbled here &amp; there,   but i wouldn&amp;#8217;t allow myself to dive in.     with bob&amp;#8217;s encouragement, i did it.   it was a huge time &amp; $ commitment,   but it was worth it.     i stretched.   i was uncomfortable.</description>
