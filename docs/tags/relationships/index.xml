      <description>yesterday, we visited our friends&amp;#8217; church, poiema, one much closer to us than the one we&amp;#8217;ve been attending in north phoenix.
 it was odd doing this, as we&amp;#8217;ve been going to PVCC since we moved here, and we&amp;#8217;ve made some great friends there.   still, we were interested in checking out poiema &amp; meeting some new people.     and for those of us who know genesis, our church back in royal oak, you&amp;#8217;d know how at home we felt when we found out the following:   poiema is currently a bohemian church.</description>
