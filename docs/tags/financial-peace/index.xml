      <description>we ripped 3 links off the blue paper chain hanging in our bedroom this morning.
the chain represents our debt, each link being $1,000.
there was a time in my life when spending $1,000 was an absurd thought.
however, i came into this marriage with
$7,000 of debt that i owed on my car
+ $5,000 remaining on my school loan.
____________
$12,000 in the hole.
add that to what bob had being a homeowner with a mortgage,</description>
