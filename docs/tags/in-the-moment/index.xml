      <description>i just wanted to buy some mascara.
    i had researched it for months in relation to my preferred mascara brand of several years,   the green clinique tube i&amp;#8217;ve perpetually used beyond the recommended 4 months. 
 and as i sat in the chair receiving my impromptu 15-minute makeover,  
 i thought how comparatively impulsive it was for me to agree to this.</description>

      <description>much of my thinking takes place in the car.
i can already predict that &amp;#8212;
should a pie chart be made of the topics this blog discusses this year
&amp;#8212; a mention of car drives will be a sizable &amp;amp; tasty slice.
as i drove to work yesterday, i found myself really listening to the lyrics on KLove.
i saw drivers &amp;amp; landscape around me.
colors were vibrant &amp;amp; organic.</description>
