      <description>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens.~
 1 thessalonians 5:16-18     it&amp;#8217;s been a busy/tough past 2 weeks,   at least 4 days of which were spent sprawled on the couch in pain from a toothache.   but there was still joy in the pain, and passion to be celebrated.     the thing i&amp;#8217;m learning this month about passion is that it comes from unexpected places &amp; at unexpected times.</description>

      <description>i awoke today refreshed &amp;amp; excited to get started on the next 52 weeks.
 first question to myself:   &amp;#8220;how can i be more passionate today?&amp;#8221;     and i found this is harder to answer than i thought.   great idea, frustratingly nebulous execution.     so i&amp;#8217;m trying something i don&amp;#8217;t usually do, just to stir things up.     i&amp;#8217;m listing 5 things i&amp;#8217;m grateful for this morning.</description>

      <description>as i read through proverbs,
there is a lot of attention paid to the mess our mouths can get us in.
gossip, complaining, breaking confidences, &amp;amp; just being stupid,
it&amp;#8217;s all mentioned on the &amp;#8220;avoid&amp;#8221; list.
but, gosh, it&amp;#8217;s so hard to break those habits!
i&amp;#8217;ve been trying to cut down on my negative word quota,
and i&amp;#8217;m finding it would be a whole lot easier if it weren&amp;#8217;t for having other people around.</description>

      <title>the myth of achieving happiness</title>

      <description>when i would ask my clients what they wished to accomplish through therapy,
many shrugged &amp;amp; said half-jokingly,
&amp;#8220;to be happy.&amp;#8221;
it was hard to share in the joke;
happiness doesn&amp;#8217;t really lend itself to creating a clinical treatment plan.
this is why:
happiness is a byproduct of other things, not an end result in itself.
people want it, but we cannot achieve it if it&amp;#8217;s what we&amp;#8217;re pursuing.
i heard a pastor on the radio yesterday remind us of what we should pursue:</description>

      <description>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. this is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.~
1 thessalonians 5:16-18
it isn&amp;#8217;t easy to be grateful all the time.
my default mode is set to &amp;#8220;brood, worry, &amp;amp; complain&amp;#8221;.
switching out of that mode takes considerable effort.
i mention this because i&amp;#8217;ve been working against my default a lot lately.</description>
