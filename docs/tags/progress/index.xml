      <description>When I was in middle school, I got the itch to organize events. No, that&amp;#8217;s inaccurate. I realized the need for organization, so I did it. There wasn&amp;#8217;t really an itch, just a desire to get to the end goal and no bridges provided to it. The point is, I got started in event creation and project management shortly after I hit the double digits, so I have a little bit of experience in it.</description>

      <description>we ripped 3 links off the blue paper chain hanging in our bedroom this morning.
the chain represents our debt, each link being $1,000.
there was a time in my life when spending $1,000 was an absurd thought.
however, i came into this marriage with
$7,000 of debt that i owed on my car
+ $5,000 remaining on my school loan.
____________
$12,000 in the hole.
add that to what bob had being a homeowner with a mortgage,</description>

      <description>yesterday, we visited our friends&amp;#8217; church, poiema, one much closer to us than the one we&amp;#8217;ve been attending in north phoenix.
 it was odd doing this, as we&amp;#8217;ve been going to PVCC since we moved here, and we&amp;#8217;ve made some great friends there.   still, we were interested in checking out poiema &amp; meeting some new people.     and for those of us who know genesis, our church back in royal oak, you&amp;#8217;d know how at home we felt when we found out the following:   poiema is currently a bohemian church.</description>
