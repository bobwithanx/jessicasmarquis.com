      <description>It&amp;#8217;s taken me a long time to learn forgiveness is not contingent on the other&amp;#8217;s apology. To refuse to forgive until the other says sorry is like refusing to go to work until someone sends a taxi for me, even though I have my own car.</description>

      <description>Dear patrons of the local Mexican restaurant my family frequents,
Thank you for allowing my husband and me to argue in your midst. Thank you for averting your eyes and not [audibly] questioning our decision to hash it all out in front of our young children. This has been a long journey for us to get to this place in our marriage, where we can be real with each other and show our disagreements instead of forced pleasantries.</description>
