      <h1>days #26-#30</h1>
    </header>

    <p>this week has been busy &amp; full of life lessons.</p>

<p>i&#8217;ve traveled to &amp; from tucson (soon to be to &amp; from again),</p>

<p>assisted bob in editing our film to submit to a film festival,</p>

<p>attempted to actually get some work done at the office,</p>

<p>and engaged in a work activity that involved downtown PHX &amp; the light rail.</p>

<p>that last one is what i want to really examine right now.</p>

<p>the concept of this event was a photo collage of an adventure with coworkers.</p>

<p>the purpose of it was to get us out of the office &amp; learning about each other.</p>

<p>but that doesn&#8217;t mean i wasn&#8217;t partially dreading it.</p>

<p>my comfort zone is somewhat nebulous, but there is a key trait:</p>

<p>i act alone.</p>

<p>pushing my boundaries is a lot easier when i don&#8217;t have someone there pushing them with me.</p>

<p>and this event forced me to push my boundaries with 5 people i barely know in a teamwork event.</p>

<p>can i tell you a secret?</p>

<p>it was great.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">  in my cynical college-student days,

  i would&amp;#8217;ve referred to this as mandated fun.

  that day, though, i actually got it.

  riding on the light rail, racing from museum to library,

  i felt like i was expanding.

  (it was probably just my comfort zone that was shape-shifting, but i could feel myself going along with it.)


  &lt;i&gt;passion is messy, and it must not be assigned parameters.&lt;/i&gt;

  when i sit in a comfort zone of my own design with fences to keep me inside,

  i miss out on the energy right outside it.


  if i keep on doing what i&amp;#8217;ve done before,

  i&amp;#8217;ll just keep creating what i&amp;#8217;ve created before.


  that&amp;#8217;s boring.


  God created us as relational beings,

  and we need more than just ourselves to make real magic happen in this world.

  so i now have 5 more people in my life, 5 more sources of creativity &amp; magic.</pre></div>
