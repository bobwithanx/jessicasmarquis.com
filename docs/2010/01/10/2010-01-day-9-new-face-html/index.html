      <h1>day #9: a new face</h1>
    </header>

    <p>i just wanted to buy some mascara.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#e5e5e5;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">  i had researched it for months in relation to my preferred mascara brand of several years,

  the green clinique tube i&amp;#8217;ve perpetually used beyond the recommended 4 months.

  and as i sat in the chair receiving my impromptu 15-minute makeover,</pre></div>
<p>i thought how comparatively impulsive it was for me to agree to <i>this</i>.</p>

<p>the artist, a friendly woman named debbie, worked quickly as she informed me about the various products coating my face &amp; eyes.</p>

<p>she insisted my skin was dry &amp; required &#8220;hydration&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;hydration&#8221; apparently feels like lacquer.</p>

<p>now don&#8217;t get me wrong:</p>

<p>i love makeup.</p>

<p>i have a kaboodle kit &#8212;</p>

<p>yes, i still own one</p>

<p>&#8212; filled with various eyeshadows, lipsticks, &amp; eyeliners that i employee throughout the week.</p>

<p>i&#8217;ve been wearing an evolving regimen of products since i was 12.</p>

<p>and i&#8217;ve settled on the fact that i am a lips &amp; eye girl.</p>

<p>but even those are in moderation.</p>

<p>so when i peeked in the mirror after the final coat of mascara was applied,</p>

<p>i was shocked at the array of colors that greeted me.</p>

<p>after the initial befuddlement that impaired my response system,</p>

<p>i was able to stammer that it was &#8220;fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>after some careful blending &amp; strategic product removal,</p>

<p>i could confess i kinda liked it.</p>

<p>you know, in that way that accepts a new situation but offers no personal commitment to it.</p>

<p>debbie was pleased with her creation, having admittedly gotten carried away during the process due to me practicing a yes-and mentality.</p>

<p>D: &#8220;i&#8217;m going to do two types of mascara, jessica.&#8221;</p>

<p>J: &#8220;yes, and why not make it extra thick!&#8221;</p>

<p>i drove away with my new mascara &amp; nothing more,</p>

<p>save the free products that were thrown in for being a first-time customer</p>

<p>(&amp;, i like to believe, a good sport).</p>

<p>at each stoplight, i chipped a few more layers off the spider-web eyelashes on my left eye,</p>

<p>the length of which,</p>

<p>due to the length-enhancing serum within <i>that</i> one type of mascara,</p>

<p>bore a striking resemblance to falsies.</p>

<p>my glossified lips formed into a smile at how i&#8217;d embraced an opportunity atypical to me:</p>

<p>i met a new person &amp; tried on a new face, all in the course of a fraction of an hour.</p>

<p><i>passion this year is about trying new things &amp; experiencing the consequences,</i></p>

<p><i>rather than fearing those consequences and missing out.</i></p>

<p>the cost of a tube of mascara was worth that lesson this afternoon.</p>
