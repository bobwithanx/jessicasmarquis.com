      <h1>kids these days</h1>
    </header>

    <p>it was on my first mission trip at age 14 that i realized that being young could be a useful thing.<br />
somehow, i had picked up on the message that a person could not do something of worth until s/he was an &#8220;adult&#8221;.<br />
seeing the zeal of my peers &amp; the products of our Christ-focused teamwork convinced me:<br />
Jesus really can use people under the age of 18!</p>

<p>what bothers me, though, is that there continues to be evidence of reverse ageism when it comes to leadership in the church.<br />
i am not foolish enough to think that young people have the wisdom of their elders,<br />
but i am idealistic enough to believe that they can accomplish a lot more than they are often encouraged to aspire to.<br />
while there is ongoing dialogue focusing on the unfair attention paid to youthful appearance,<br />
it misses the under-empowerment of younger leaders due to favoring established figures.</p>

<p>Jesus called the little children to Him.<br />
the apostle paul told timothy not to let people look down on him for his age.</p>

<p>there are progressive, Jesus-following communities taking action to include &amp; utilize the tweeners, teens, millenials, &amp; gen-Xers.<br />
these are the communities we spend time in &amp; serve through.<br />
it&#8217;s time for ALL AGES to be valued &amp; recognized as of worth to our King.<br />
we can all teach &amp; learn from each other.</p>
