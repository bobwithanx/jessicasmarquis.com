    <p>~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. this is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.~<br />
1 thessalonians 5:16-18</p>

<p>it isn&#8217;t easy to be grateful all the time.<br />
my default mode is set to &#8220;brood, worry, &amp; complain&#8221;.<br />
switching out of that mode takes considerable effort.<br />
i mention this because i&#8217;ve been working against my default a lot lately.<br />
we&#8217;re trying to sell our house back in detroit with a nasty economy,<br />
and we&#8217;re working our way out of an equally nasty financial situation.</p>

<p>so let&#8217;s get thankful, eh?<br />
well, if that&#8217;s what you want, God, i&#8217;ll give it my best shot.</p>

<p>the first step for me to get there was to realize that,<br />
when faced with a problem,<br />
i shook my puny fist at God &amp; declared loudly,<br />
&#8220;this sucks!&#8221;<br />
and, of course, i went through the ick &amp; guck &amp; was better for it.<br />
so i started to see a problem &amp; think,<br />
&#8220;this sucks, but not really because something cool will come from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>note: this was not because i was becoming a better person;<br />
it was totally because God was taking over.<br />
left to myself, i would still be shaking my fist &amp; complaining about my rotator cuff.</p>

<p>so He got me thinking about giving thanks.<br />
and i started doing it each time i felt beat down.<br />
&#8220;this sucks&#8221; &#8212;&gt; &#8220;&#8230;so thank You!&#8221;</p>

<p>it&#8217;s getting easier with practice,<br />
and i can tell God&#8217;s claimed more parts of me as a result.<br />
that in itself is something i can give thanks for&#8230;<br />
amidst the suckiness&#8230;<br />
which probably isn&#8217;t that sucky after all.</p>
