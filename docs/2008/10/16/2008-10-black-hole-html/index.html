    </header>

    <p>my mouth gets me into a lot of trouble.<br />
don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212;<br />
i TRY to make it do good things.<br />
but sometimes it just seems to have a mind of its own.</p>

<p>in reading ephesians 4, it&#8217;s interesting how many things we are warned against that have to do with our mouths.<br />
even the indirect ones, like being angry, are often expressed through words.</p>

<p>so how do we keep our black holes from sucking us into oblivion?</p>

<p>i&#8217;ve been trying to team up with the Spirit within me to get some of this tendency-toward-implosion under control.<br />
trouble is that i like to do it on my terms,<br />
and i find myself using my mouth to do a lot of the talking.<br />
the Spirit, though, seems to prefer me to quiet down.<br />
It wants to share some ideas on self-control, being that self-control is one of Its very own fruits.</p>

<p>so what am i learning?<br />
to slow down.<br />
to listen up.<br />
to stay in rhythm with the Spirit, who in turn guides my words.</p>

<p>now, i&#8217;m still human.<br />
so the words aren&#8217;t always spot on,<br />
and sometimes they are COMPLETELY off.<br />
but then my mouth can do something really useful:<br />
apologize.</p>

<p>i know i can&#8217;t seal the black hole,<br />
but i guess i&#8217;m praying that God will make me into a supernova.<br />
a supernova that is really good at listening to Him.</p>
