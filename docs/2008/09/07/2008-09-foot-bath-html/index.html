      <h1>the foot bath</h1>
    </header>

    <p>i am fascinated by the thought of Jesus washing feet.<br />
regardless of cultural tradition &amp; symbolism, i just love that this Guy cared SO MUCH about the other guys He hung out with that He took on one of the stinkiest parts of the male body.<br />
that is LOVE.</p>

<p>but here&#8217;s the kicker &#8212;<br />
He tells them that He has to wash all their feet to include them in what He was doing.<br />
(i&#8217;m sure judas was plenty perturbed by that thought.)<br />
see, Jesus wanted them to feel what it is like to be honored by one who does not need to do so.</p>

<p>because that was their assignment after He left.</p>

<p>in reading this story, it has nudged me to think about ways i can wash others&#8217; feet.<br />
i&#8217;m not all that into the act of it, so i&#8217;m sticking with the symbolism of it:<br />
showing humble love &amp; respect toward another.<br />
it&#8217;s a bit more personal than tossing an extra $1 into the make-a-wish jar at the store.</p>

<p>so i guess i&#8217;m on a quest to become a human foot bath.</p>
