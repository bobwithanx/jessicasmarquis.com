As women, so many of us enjoy sharing our life stories & advice we have learned with people we think need it. However, this isn&#8217;t always helpful &#8211; if we were honest with ourselves, all too often we share for ourselves & not to truly benefit the hearer. This act of non-listening can create distance between ourselves & others&#8230;and those &#8220;others&#8221; may be our children or husbands. Let&#8217;s all ask the Spirit for guidance next time we have an urge to speak into another&#8217;s life, so that our words are life-giving & blessed by God!

~Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry&#8230;~  
James 1:19
