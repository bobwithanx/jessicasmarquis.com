A great tragedy is that guilt has become associated with God. Not only is this not one of His choice tools, it&#8217;s not one of His tools at all! When the Spirit convicts our hearts, the message is not a harsh, &#8220;Get this right and then we&#8217;ll talk,&#8221; but a gentle, &#8220;Hey, see that thing over there? Would you please give it to Me? It&#8217;s getting in the way of us being closer.&#8221;

He will take it away or transform it in His power, working within us, not waiting for us to shape up or ship out. We don&#8217;t try harder &#8211; we just let Him get to work.

When the Spirit convicts us, the choice of how to respond is always ours. As are the consequences.
