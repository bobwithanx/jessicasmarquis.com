When you come from a background where your parents&#8217; parenting was ineffective (or worse), it can be a real worry that you will repeat their legacy. The great news is that when we have an active, grace-filled relationship with our loving Daddy, He enters in & rewrites the story! But we desperately need to be in community, humbly listening to others & accepting wisdom where we are lacking. This doesn&#8217;t mean we take every piece of unsolicited advice that comes our way, but rather we use discernment to recognize that God brings us together as a Body to raise His precious little ones!
