today is my mom&#8217;s birthday.

  she&#8217;s 29 & holding.

  if there is anyone in this world who exhibits obvious passion in her life,

  it&#8217;s my mom.


  mom loves teaching, as well as the kids in her class.

  when i call her to catch up, i am always an audience to her stories of their successes or tragedies &#8212;

  but most often their successes, since she believes so much in them.

  (she does hurt when they hurt, too, and she shares this pain openly.)


  passion for life, her family, and her faith drives my mom.

  people love being around her because she exudes energy & positivity.


  i am grateful to have such direct access to a real-life role model.

  if you read this, mom, happy birthday.
