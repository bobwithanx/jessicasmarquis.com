spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.

  this is a passion i&#8217;ve put off for a while.

  i&#8217;ve dabbled here & there,

  but i wouldn&#8217;t allow myself to dive in.


  with bob&#8217;s encouragement, i did it.

  it was a huge time & $ commitment,

  but it was worth it.


  i stretched.

  i was uncomfortable.

  i was creative.

  and now there is no turning back.

  to have that kind of opportunity & not do anything with it is ungrateful & unwise.


  <i>this year, passion is about seeking out deferred opportunities & acting upon them.</i>

  right now, i&#8217;m just feeling out a script concept,

  but that won&#8217;t be where it ends.


  please hold me to that. ðŸ˜‰
