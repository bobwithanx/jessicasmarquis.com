i don&#8217;t know why i don&#8217;t get it.  
i&#8217;ve gone through it multiple times each year,  
but i forget the protocol every time.

God gives me a dream.  
i get excited.  
i started to dream with this dream.

and this is where i go wrong.

i cling to the dream.  
God asks for it back.  
i tell him i want to figure it out first, that i have some great ideas.  
He asks for it back.  
i say no.  
He waits patiently & keeps success from flowing to me.  
i get frustrated because He gave me a dream & isn&#8217;t coming through for me.  
He waits patiently.  
i get angry & cry & throw tantrums asking why He isn&#8217;t blessing me.  
He waits patiently.  
i realize He&#8217;s still asking for the dream back.

and this is where is where i go right.

i give it back.  
He works within me & with the dream.  
He gives it back to me bigger & better.  
and i&#8217;m more able to handle it & be part of making it what it&#8217;s meant to be:  
His, not mine.

so dream 1.0 is really just an alpha.  
i try to make it a beta.  
God wants to launch it, but He wants it to be fully functional:  
dream 2.0.

i&#8217;m praying that He&#8217;ll help me to delete steps from the places i go wrong.  
i&#8217;m praying that He&#8217;ll help me give up dream 1.0 & trust Him with the process.
