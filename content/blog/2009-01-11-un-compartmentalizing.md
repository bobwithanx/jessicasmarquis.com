here&#8217;s my geek moment of the day:
i was looking at the word &#8220;Goals&#8221; & realized that if you put the a & l closer to each other&#8230;
&#8230;it says &#8220;Gods&#8221;.
(which i interpreted to be &#8220;God&#8217;s&#8221;.)

so here&#8217;s why i allowed that thought to take up more than a nanosecond of my time:
i have a tendency to keep things separate.
i would set my goals for the day, week, month, year, whatever,
and then i&#8217;d think,
&#8220;oh, i should really include God somewhere in there.&#8221;

so i&#8217;d give Him a goal just for Him.
and keep the rest mine.

so today, looking at my goals for 2009, i thought to myself,
&#8220;have i included God in all of them?
after all, i am His child, and i&#8217;m totally wacko in love with Him.
why *wouldn&#8217;t* i make sure that He&#8217;s part of these?&#8221;

since i couldn&#8217;t find an answer to that last question, i&#8217;m praying over the goals to make sure they&#8217;re in line with my loving Daddy&#8217;s leading.

happy new year to you all,
and best wishes on setting your 2009 Goals!
