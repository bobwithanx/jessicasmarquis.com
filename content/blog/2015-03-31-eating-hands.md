My kiddos are adorable, but not brilliant. At least, not yet. When I go to nurse their hungry little 4-month-old mouths, I often find they have preemptively shoved a fist into it. In an effort to sate their appetite, they find something that works in a tactile way but not nutritionally.

If only they knew to wait! That their mama is equipped and happy to provide them with what they need to thrive!

And yet I do this so often with my own loving Daddy. I&#8217;m hungry, desiring something that could very well be good for me, but before He meets that hunger I stuff my face (figuratively) with something inadequate, but something I can control.

In time, my boys will learn to keep their hands out of the way when it comes time to eat, just as their older sister eventually did. I pray that I will, too.

~Why spend money on what is not bread, and your labor on what does not
satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and you will
delight in the richest of fare.

~Isaiah 55:2
