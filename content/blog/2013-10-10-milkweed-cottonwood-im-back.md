It&#8217;s been a while, my friends! I&#8217;ve taken a few years off to quit my job, have a kid, write a book entitled _Raising Unicorns_, and start a Bible study for mamas of young kiddos called Milkweed. It&#8217;s been an amazing time of transition, and this season has brought about a slew of new insights into God&#8217;s love & grace. As a friend once shared with me:

_If you want to experience God, stay single.   
If you want to know God, get married.   
If you want to be like God, become a parent._

Welcome to this deluge of Cottonwood Blessings!
