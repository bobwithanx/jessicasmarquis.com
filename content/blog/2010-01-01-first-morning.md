i awoke today refreshed & excited to get started on the next 52 weeks.
first question to myself:
&#8220;how can i be more passionate today?&#8221;

and i found this is harder to answer than i thought.
great idea, frustratingly nebulous execution.

so i&#8217;m trying something i don&#8217;t usually do, just to stir things up.

*i&#8217;m listing 5 things i&#8217;m grateful for this morning.*

1. **sunshine**, bright & warm with a promise of high 60-degree temps today. i missed out on this for the first 3 decades of my life; i won&#8217;t take it for granted.

2. **mountains** that interrupt the horizon & display drastic textures that mess with the resulting shadows.

3. **colors** that clash & blend & harmonize.

4. **the potential of the next 24 hours.** with no school & no work on my schedule, i can make this day whatever i want.

5. **hugs from 1 husband & 2 cats.** and i won&#8217;t complain about the cat hair today.

i&#8217;m already feeling more energized.

good morning, 2010.
