~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens. this is the way God wants you who belong to Christ Jesus to live.~  
1 thessalonians 5:16-18

it isn&#8217;t easy to be grateful all the time.  
my default mode is set to &#8220;brood, worry, & complain&#8221;.  
switching out of that mode takes considerable effort.  
i mention this because i&#8217;ve been working against my default a lot lately.  
we&#8217;re trying to sell our house back in detroit with a nasty economy,  
and we&#8217;re working our way out of an equally nasty financial situation.

so let&#8217;s get thankful, eh?  
well, if that&#8217;s what you want, God, i&#8217;ll give it my best shot.

the first step for me to get there was to realize that,  
when faced with a problem,  
i shook my puny fist at God & declared loudly,  
&#8220;this sucks!&#8221;  
and, of course, i went through the ick & guck & was better for it.  
so i started to see a problem & think,  
&#8220;this sucks, but not really because something cool will come from it.&#8221;

note: this was not because i was becoming a better person;  
it was totally because God was taking over.  
left to myself, i would still be shaking my fist & complaining about my rotator cuff.

so He got me thinking about giving thanks.  
and i started doing it each time i felt beat down.  
&#8220;this sucks&#8221; &#8212;> &#8220;&#8230;so thank You!&#8221;

it&#8217;s getting easier with practice,  
and i can tell God&#8217;s claimed more parts of me as a result.  
that in itself is something i can give thanks for&#8230;  
amidst the suckiness&#8230;  
which probably isn&#8217;t that sucky after all.
