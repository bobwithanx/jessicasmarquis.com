my senses go into overload a lot.

  sometimes i get mentally overwhelmed,

  and other times i just automatically block out some of the stimuli.

  default attention-selection.


  today as i walked in the brisk air to the mailbox, i decided to close my eyes.

  shutting down that one sense ignited the others!

  i felt the subtle breeze & smelled a pre-rain odor.

  my tastebuds recalled the soy chai i had earlier.

  i heard neighborhood life.


  and all because i limited the input.


  mind you, the scenery was fantastic.

  a pastel-blending sunset framing the mountains.

  there was nothing i wanted to avoid,

  except for overstimulation.


  <i>for me, passion is about mindfulness, being alive from second to second.</i>

  but i get distracted, especially when life is happening.

  you know, like all the time.


  so today i&#8217;m taking time to shut down senses,

  focusing on the sensations that remain.
