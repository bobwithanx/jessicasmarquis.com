i&#8217;ve been working with a friend on creating a film piece on trees.  
God really seemed to have an affinity to that metaphor.  
we&#8217;re finding that we do, too.

the trees of our Lord are sturdy & dependable,  
and they are dependent on Him for life & sustenance.  
they don&#8217;t run out of fruit &#8212; ever!  
and, gosh, does He ever love & care for them.

we&#8217;re excited to make this piece to share His love of trees with others in His forest.  
in the meantime,  
let&#8217;s all take a break & ask if we&#8217;re really sticking to His job description for His trees.
