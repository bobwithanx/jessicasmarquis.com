i just wanted to buy some mascara.


      i had researched it for months in relation to my preferred mascara brand of several years,

      the green clinique tube i&#8217;ve perpetually used beyond the recommended 4 months.

      and as i sat in the chair receiving my impromptu 15-minute makeover,

  i thought how comparatively impulsive it was for me to agree to <i>this</i>.


  the artist, a friendly woman named debbie, worked quickly as she informed me about the various products coating my face & eyes.

  she insisted my skin was dry & required &#8220;hydration&#8221;.

  &#8220;hydration&#8221; apparently feels like lacquer.


  now don&#8217;t get me wrong:

  i love makeup.

  i have a kaboodle kit &#8212;

  yes, i still own one

  &#8212; filled with various eyeshadows, lipsticks, & eyeliners that i employee throughout the week.

  i&#8217;ve been wearing an evolving regimen of products since i was 12.

  and i&#8217;ve settled on the fact that i am a lips & eye girl.

  but even those are in moderation.


  so when i peeked in the mirror after the final coat of mascara was applied,

  i was shocked at the array of colors that greeted me.


  after the initial befuddlement that impaired my response system,

  i was able to stammer that it was &#8220;fun.&#8221;

  after some careful blending & strategic product removal,

  i could confess i kinda liked it.


  you know, in that way that accepts a new situation but offers no personal commitment to it.


  debbie was pleased with her creation, having admittedly gotten carried away during the process due to me practicing a yes-and mentality.


  D: &#8220;i&#8217;m going to do two types of mascara, jessica.&#8221;

  J: &#8220;yes, and why not make it extra thick!&#8221;


  i drove away with my new mascara & nothing more,

  save the free products that were thrown in for being a first-time customer

  (&, i like to believe, a good sport).

  at each stoplight, i chipped a few more layers off the spider-web eyelashes on my left eye,

  the length of which,

  due to the length-enhancing serum within <i>that</i> one type of mascara,

  bore a striking resemblance to falsies.


  my glossified lips formed into a smile at how i&#8217;d embraced an opportunity atypical to me:

  i met a new person & tried on a new face, all in the course of a fraction of an hour.


  <i>passion this year is about trying new things & experiencing the consequences,</i>

  <i>rather than fearing those consequences and missing out.</i>

  the cost of a tube of mascara was worth that lesson this afternoon.
