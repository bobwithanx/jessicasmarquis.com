as i read through proverbs,  
there is a lot of attention paid to the mess our mouths can get us in.

gossip, complaining, breaking confidences, & just being stupid,  
it&#8217;s all mentioned on the &#8220;avoid&#8221; list.

but, gosh, it&#8217;s so hard to break those habits!

i&#8217;ve been trying to cut down on my negative word quota,  
and i&#8217;m finding it would be a whole lot easier if it weren&#8217;t for having other people around.  
instant popularity is not found in saying,  
&#8220;no thanks, i&#8217;m not into talking about other people in a slanderous manner.&#8221;

however, my outlook is improving as i pipe up with thankfulness.  
at the risk of sounding pollyannaish,   
i&#8217;m looking on the brightside because it&#8217;s a heck of a lot more attractive.

God rewards those who follow His advice.  
i&#8217;m working to make my words more attractive to Him.  
who wants to join me?
