Lesson I&#8217;ve witnessed over and over: It may seem the same to you, but don&#8217;t assume you know what the other person is feeling. Doing so is like a slap to the face.

Here is the Hierarchy of Face Slaps that tend to commence once someone has made that assumption:

1. They say, &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re feeling.&#8221;

2. They hijack the conversation to share their story.

3. Their story is nothing like yours.

4. Their story is not nearly as weighty as yours.

5. They try to justify it.

6. You&#8217;re given the responsibility of ending the conversation they forced upon you.

Pay it forward: Don&#8217;t claim another&#8217;s pain as yours. Just listen.
