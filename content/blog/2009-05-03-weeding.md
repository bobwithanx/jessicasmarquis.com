i&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about weeds,  
particularly the ones in the parable of the sower.  
in the first two scenarios the seeds didn&#8217;t really get much of a chance:  
birds ate &#8217;em or the sun scorched &#8217;em because they didn&#8217;t really have good roots.

but in the third scenario,  
the weeds,  
the seeds were able to burrow down & begin to grow.

their success was compromised not by the soil but by the setting.

had they not succumbed to the distractions, temptations, & life worries,  
they would have flourished.  
and that is what sticks with me.

how much of my growth is compromised by my setting & its effect on me?  
what are the weeds that twist around & choke out the life developing within me?

i&#8217;ve been thinking about weeds so i can get better at identifying them,  
so i can find better soil & become a tree.
