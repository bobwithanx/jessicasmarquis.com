been reading through 1 thessalonians, & skipping over parts.

  this is amusing to me, as the book is only 4 pages long in <i>the message</i> bible.

  however, i found i couldn&#8217;t relate with some elements & moved on.


  and then i took a moment this morning to ask myself:

  why can&#8217;t i relate?

  what are those elements?


  the answer was this:

  i couldn&#8217;t relate with the intensity of love that paul expressed toward the thessalonians.

  he genuinely loved them.

  an intense philos love.

  and that doesn&#8217;t compute for me.


  to me, philos love is a just nice, pleasant thing.

  i&#8217;m unfamiliar with it having the passion of eros.

  to hear it expressed to that level seems fraudulent, insincere.

  but as i&#8217;ve gone back & read it over, it&#8217;s completely sincere.

  paul really liked these people!


  so my passion paradigms are shifting a smidge this morning:

  <i>aching passion can be expressed in friendship & platonic appreciation.</i>


  that doesn&#8217;t jive with me quite yet, but i&#8217;m open to examples.

  today, i&#8217;m questioning the boundaries & limits i&#8217;ve placed on these relationships in my life.
