gardening isn&#8217;t really my thing.  
still, i&#8217;m fascinated by the thought of mulching.  
being able to use the refuse of plants to produce new & healthy plants is so ingenious to me.

and as i ponder this,  
i realize that my Gardener is in the business of mulching.  
because i&#8217;ve got a ton of refuse that i&#8217;ve accumulated from

  * poor choices
  * shameful actions
  * skeletons in the closet

and i often don&#8217;t think anything good can come out of that stuff.

it&#8217;s a good thing God disagrees with me.  
it&#8217;s a good thing He composts my past & mulches it up to make my present & future beautiful.  
the past doesn&#8217;t get eradicated &#8212;  
it is made functional for His purposes.

jessica jessica, how does your garden grow?  
with lots of loving mulching that i can&#8217;t do on my own.
