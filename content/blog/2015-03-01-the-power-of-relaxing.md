So I was driving home this evening from taking my 3 sick kiddos & under-the-weather self to see my dad off to his flight back to Hungary, and I heard an interview with DJ Dan Deacon. In honor of the end of this week of rest in Milkweed, read this excerpt & prepare to have your brain shifted a bit!

_&#8220;I was doing what I thought was relaxing, but was actually just killing time: I was on Facebook. And a friend of mine posted a video from the Toronto Film Festival of Bill Murray talking about his approach to acting â€” or his philosophy about life, I guess. And it just completely blew me away, because he said, &#8216;Whatever your job is, the more relaxed you are, the better you are.&#8217;_

And to me this was just like, &#8216;What are you talking about? I forgot that word even existed!&#8217; Because I very much was a person who was motivated by stress; I would use a deadline as a motivator. I think a lot of people do that, where they&#8217;re like, &#8216;I&#8217;ll just wait until the last minute, and that&#8217;ll light a fire underneath me and I&#8217;ll get it done.&#8217; And I just kept thinking, &#8216;Well, that&#8217;s a terrible way to live. Why am I building a house and lighting a fire in the basement just to see if I can finish the roof before it burns down my whole house?&#8217;_

I started realizing how important it is to truly relax, and in relaxing, to be bored. You have to be bored. If you&#8217;re not bored, your mind is never gonna wander, and if your mind never wanders, you&#8217;re never gonna get lost in thought, and you&#8217;re never gonna find yourself thinking things you wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise thought.&#8221;_
