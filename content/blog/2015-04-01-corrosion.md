As I&#8217;ve spent time in authentic community &#8211; something I avoided for years out of fear of being known &#8211; I have started to see how the Spirit has re-sensitized me. Or perhaps there is no &#8220;re-&#8220;; perhaps it&#8217;s for the first time.

For example, today I experienced a frustration, and I thought through a careful reaction & implemented it. But I still felt lousy about it, despite the tactfulness I was so fastidious to apply. And then I realized why my spirit wasn&#8217;t at peace: It was because I hadn&#8217;t gone to the Spirit first to get my feelings in check & my perspective adjusted. I had done it &#8220;in the flesh&#8221;, to borrow an old-school churchy term.

I guess I see my prayers as a battery that has tons of corrosion that has built up on its ends from slow leaks. Some energy still gets through from time to time, but it&#8217;s more the exception than the rule. The easiest thing is to toss the whole mess out & just say, &#8220;Screw it all.&#8221; But my loving Daddy has given me this new chance to let Him chisel away at the muck, replenishing the juice inside and giving my terminal a polished sheen so all the volts can get through. 

And I couldn&#8217;t do it on my own, because prayer is just a transaction when I&#8217;m on the go. When no one is holding me accountable, I tend to just present a list of wants, sorries, and sometimes a thank-you. But being around others who are conversing with God gets me to the relationship part, which is really what prayer is about anyway. I&#8217;m sensitized & charged up & ready to connect.
