today is my mom&#8217;s birthday.

<div>
  she&#8217;s 29 & holding.
</div>

<div>
  if there is anyone in this world who exhibits obvious passion in her life,
</div>

<div>
  it&#8217;s my mom.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  mom loves teaching, as well as the kids in her class.
</div>

<div>
  when i call her to catch up, i am always an audience to her stories of their successes or tragedies &#8212;
</div>

<div>
  but most often their successes, since she believes so much in them.
</div>

<div>
  (she does hurt when they hurt, too, and she shares this pain openly.)
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  passion for life, her family, and her faith drives my mom.
</div>

<div>
  people love being around her because she exudes energy & positivity.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  i am grateful to have such direct access to a real-life role model.
</div>

<div>
  if you read this, mom, happy birthday.
