Please take a moment to STOP, READ, & PRAY on the following statement. It applies to so many of us. Our Savior can & _wants_ to free us all in this way! Thank You, loving Daddy. Guide us out of our shackles.

~When Christ redeemed you, He forgave your moral indebtedness and your wrongdoing. You were spiritually reconciled to God&#8230; But if you haven&#8217;t received a second reconciliation &#8211; a financial reconciliation in which the power of God breaks the power of money in your life, His love cleanses your shame and guilt about your financial state, and the Holy Spirit fills you with the power to move ahead with all-new financial practices &#8211; well, friend, in my opinion, you&#8217;re still one reconciliation short. You cannot be fully free from shame and guilt until you experience that second redemption.~
