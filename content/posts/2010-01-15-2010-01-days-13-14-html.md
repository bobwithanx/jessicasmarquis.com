learning to simplify.

  <i>it&#8217;s hard to experience passion when i&#8217;m pulled in numerous directions.</i>

  i might mistake the ache of excitement for just an ache of overload &#8212;

  if i feel the ache at all.


  throughout the past several years, i&#8217;ve been learning about setting boundaries.

  this includes knowing my limits & respecting them,

  while also pushing those that have growth potential.


  this requires some interesting conditional formatting in my life&#8217;s excel table.


  IF stretching in this area leads to simplification & joy,

  THEN seek stretching opportunities.


  IF stretching in this area leads to burnout & misery,

  THEN set a boundary to honor known limits.


  so as i&#8217;m simplifying, i&#8217;m reviewing some of my established boundaries.


  for example, i&#8217;m currently working full-time & going to school full-time.

  i&#8217;m also involved in making films with bob, writing articles for publication, maintaining this blog & my comic blog, attending church, networking socially/professionally, & other activities.

  my time can only be divided so many ways, though,

  so i&#8217;m evaluating ways to better simplify my activities so i can create room for passion.


  bob, on the other hand, simplifies by removing clutter.

  he feels open to creativity when his stuff if physically organized & stored away.


  it&#8217;s interesting all the preparations we need to make to welcome flow.

  perhaps a dose of preventative medicine would be helpful next time&#8230;


  what are some ways you&#8217;ve simplified your life?
