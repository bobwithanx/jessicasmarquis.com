been reading through 1 thessalonians, & skipping over parts.

<div>
  this is amusing to me, as the book is only 4 pages long in <i>the message</i> bible.
</div>

<div>
  however, i found i couldn&#8217;t relate with some elements & moved on.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  and then i took a moment this morning to ask myself:
</div>

<div>
  why can&#8217;t i relate?
</div>

<div>
  what are those elements?
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  the answer was this:
</div>

<div>
  i couldn&#8217;t relate with the intensity of love that paul expressed toward the thessalonians.
</div>

<div>
  he genuinely loved them.
</div>

<div>
  an intense philos love.
</div>

<div>
  and that doesn&#8217;t compute for me.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  to me, philos love is a just nice, pleasant thing.
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;m unfamiliar with it having the passion of eros.
</div>

<div>
  to hear it expressed to that level seems fraudulent, insincere.
</div>

<div>
  but as i&#8217;ve gone back & read it over, it&#8217;s completely sincere.
</div>

<div>
  paul really liked these people!
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  so my passion paradigms are shifting a smidge this morning:
</div>

<div>
  <i>aching passion can be expressed in friendship & platonic appreciation.</i>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  that doesn&#8217;t jive with me quite yet, but i&#8217;m open to examples.
</div>

<div>
  today, i&#8217;m questioning the boundaries & limits i&#8217;ve placed on these relationships in my life.
