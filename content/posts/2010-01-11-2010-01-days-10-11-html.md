i&#8217;m working on a list of passion-blockers.

<div>
  as i write each one down, i feel a twinge of guilt at how i&#8217;ve let it get to me in the past.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  fatigue
</div>

<div>
  denial of ability/passion
</div>

<div>
  fear
</div>

<div>
  resistance
</div>

<div>
  others&#8217; reactions
</div>

<div>
  unrealistic standards
</div>

<div>
  distraction
</div>

<div>
  formalization
</div>

<div>
  and so on&#8230;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  my internal conflict comes from my belief that Jesus,
</div>

<div>
  in all His wisdom & love,
</div>

<div>
  has given us all unique passion in each of our lives.
</div>

<div>
  however, we busy ourselves & bury the passion,
</div>

<div>
  missing a key & pivotal opportunity in our lives to experience that personal gift!
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  as i look over this emerging list of passion-blockers, my guilt is that i&#8217;ve let these take over when i could be letting passion into the mix.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  but it doesn&#8217;t have to end there.
</div>

<div>
  <i>guilt motivates; shame incapacitates.</i>
</div>

<div>
  i won&#8217;t let this turn to shame.
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;ll let the guilt motivate me to bust down some of those passion-blockers.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  the best antidote to passion-blockers is action.
</div>

<div>
  simply making movement rather than letting them paralyze reduces much of their power.
</div>

<div>
  today, when a passion-blocker shows up on the scene,
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;m starting a lively argument against it & taking action.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  it&#8217;s better than sitting still & feeling guilty forever.
</div>
