coming out from under a dark cloud.

<div>
  my passion has been tested & refined during the past few months,
</div>

<div>
  and i&#8217;m happy to say that i&#8217;m starting to see it again.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  and this time, it&#8217;s version 2.0!
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;ve come to recognize that my core values & strengths were not aligned with my behavior.
</div>

<div>
  my energy was being diffused by activities & investments that were incongruent.
</div>

<div>
  so i&#8217;ve taken some time to reacquaint myself with my &#8220;core&#8221;,
</div>

<div>
  and the plan is to work from there rather than take on whatever comes my way.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  this year, passion is about authenticity.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  it does me no good to go outside of who my Creator intended me to be:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      it depletes my energy
    </li>
    <li>
      it stunts my growth
    </li>
    <li>
      it hurts others close to me
    </li>
    <li>
      it gets really confusing
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    this morning, i sat down & wrote about my core.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    i identified that i love to create, produce, encourage, research, collaborate, & delegate
  </div>
  
  <div>
    (among many other things).
  </div>
  
  <div>
    i also wrote down what i don&#8217;t love:
  </div>
  
  <div>
    things like detailed attention to financial responsibilities & engaging in mundane activities that lack challenge.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    sure, we&#8217;ll still have to be fiscally disciplined,
  </div>
  
  <div>
    but now i can admit that i have interests & abilities in other areas which i&#8217;d like to pursue.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    that holds promise, rather than a dead end.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    i&#8217;m feeling energized this morning in a way i haven&#8217;t in months.
  </div>
  
  <div>
    i&#8217;m grateful for this Divine surge of excitement about possibilities & alignment.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    being me:
  </div>
  
  <div>
    it&#8217;s less work, with greater rewards.
  </div>
