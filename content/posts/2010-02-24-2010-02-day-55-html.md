~be cheerful no matter what; pray all the time; thank God no matter what happens.~

<div>
  1 thessalonians 5:16-18
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  it&#8217;s been a busy/tough past 2 weeks,
</div>

<div>
  at least 4 days of which were spent sprawled on the couch in pain from a toothache.
</div>

<div>
  but there was still joy in the pain, and passion to be celebrated.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  the thing i&#8217;m learning this month about passion is that it comes from unexpected places & at unexpected times.
</div>

<div>
  passion doesn&#8217;t like to be predictable or controlled.
</div>

<div>
  and it doesn&#8217;t like to be ignored.
</div>

<div>
  ignoring & not appreciating it causes it to go in search of another.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  that was why the verses at the start of this entry appealed to me.
</div>

<div>
  they&#8217;re an invitation to gratitude even when things seems off/odd/wrong.
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;m coming to recognize that it&#8217;s when things are o/o/w that passion is a breath away.
</div>

<div>
  that unpredictable, uncontrollable creativity is being dislodged.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  today, i&#8217;m appreciative of the interruption that breaks my routine,
</div>

<div>
  the uncomfortable challenge that introduces me to new people,
</div>

<div>
  the rote homework assignment that goes tangential into a new area of discovery.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  today, i am praying to be perpetually, sincerely thankful.
