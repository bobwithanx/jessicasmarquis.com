i&#8217;ve been off the grid, indulging a growing passion:

<div>
  bob, a team of PHX creatives, & i made a full microshort this weekend.
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      we&#8217;ve been making films together since we met:
    </div>
    
    <div>
      he directs, i write, & we make magic happen.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      it&#8217;s tough working so closely & intensely sometimes,
    </div>
    
    <div>
      and we&#8217;ve learned a lot about teamwork through it all.
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      i guess my passion for making films goes hand-in-hand with my passion for my marriage.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      i see them as linked, since they have been since day 1.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      i mean, we met because of a video camera!
    </div>
    
    <div>
      (for that story, <a href="http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/tattoo-keeps-couple-close?click=main_sr">here is the article.</a>)
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      my trouble is that i can be extremely passionate,
    </div>
    
    <div>
      and when something goes awry i don&#8217;t know how else to react but to smother my flame.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      it&#8217;s like i&#8217;m saying,
    </div>
    
    <div>
      &#8220;if this isn&#8217;t going to go my way, i&#8217;ll just pretend i don&#8217;t care at all.&#8221;
    </div>
    
    <div>
      self-sabotage.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      neither films nor good marriages get made that way.
    </div>
    
    <div>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      this year, passion means keeping the flame alive even when the wind blows,
    </div>
    
    <div>
      the oxygen is all but gone,
    </div>
    
    <div>
      and all i want to do is snuff out the wick.
    </div>
    
    <div>
      it means fanning the flame & believing that a fire can result.
    </div>
  </div>
