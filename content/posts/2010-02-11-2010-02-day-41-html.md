it&#8217;s a birthday party!

<div>
  i&#8217;ve been tied up with work, school, & a sick cat,
</div>

<div>
  and today is bob&#8217;s birthday.
</div>

<div>
  but i&#8217;ve managed to make time & create space to embrace this special day.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  birthdays are an interesting phenomenon.
</div>

<div>
  they&#8217;re a celebration of life & the uniqueness of each person,
</div>

<div>
  but they can also be times of stress & the unpleasantry of unmet expectations.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  today, i&#8217;m going easy on myself & bob so we can truly enjoy his day.
</div>

<div>
  <i>this year, passion is about celebrating the celebrations,</i>
</div>

<div>
  <i>not freaking out & worrying over them.</i>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  after all, it&#8217;s the improvised moments that mean the most in the end.
