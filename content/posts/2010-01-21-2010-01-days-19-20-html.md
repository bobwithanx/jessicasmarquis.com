my senses go into overload a lot.

<div>
  sometimes i get mentally overwhelmed,
</div>

<div>
  and other times i just automatically block out some of the stimuli.
</div>

<div>
  default attention-selection.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  today as i walked in the brisk air to the mailbox, i decided to close my eyes.
</div>

<div>
  shutting down that one sense ignited the others!
</div>

<div>
  i felt the subtle breeze & smelled a pre-rain odor.
</div>

<div>
  my tastebuds recalled the soy chai i had earlier.
</div>

<div>
  i heard neighborhood life.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  and all because i limited the input.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  mind you, the scenery was fantastic.
</div>

<div>
  a pastel-blending sunset framing the mountains.
</div>

<div>
  there was nothing i wanted to avoid,
</div>

<div>
  except for overstimulation.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <i>for me, passion is about mindfulness, being alive from second to second.</i>
</div>

<div>
  <i><br /></i>
</div>

<div>
  but i get distracted, especially when life is happening.
</div>

<div>
  you know, like all the time.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  so today i&#8217;m taking time to shut down senses,
</div>

<div>
  focusing on the sensations that remain.
</div>
