God is our Rescuer. That doesn&#8217;t mean His rescue will come right away &#8211; it depends on what He wants to accomplish in your life through your current trial. Still, He will always protect you from what will destroy that which He plans to accomplish in & through you. He will be your Refuge, He will be right by your side, when you call on Him. (Psalm 91:14-15)
