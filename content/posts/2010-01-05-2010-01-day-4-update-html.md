bob has climbed aboard my attempt to mix it up, and we went on our own adventure tonight.

<div>
  in the 4+ years we&#8217;ve been together, i&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ve ever &#8220;gone out for a drink&#8221;.
</div>

<div>
  tonight, we took a break from our schedules,
</div>

<div>
  claimed a happy hour,
</div>

<div>
  & descended on <a href="http://www.sidebarphoenix.com/">sidebar</a>.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  we sat on a couch in a dimly lit upstairs bar with no more than 10 other people,
</div>

<div>
  an old kung-fu movie playing on various flat-screens around us.
</div>

<div>
  we sipped wine & brainstormed on upcoming projects,
</div>

<div>
  much like we had when we were dating.
</div>

<div>
  we flirted like we weren&#8217;t married.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <i>married passion in its most basic form.</i>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  the other night, we privately &#8220;renewed our vows&#8221; by simply promising all the things we hadn&#8217;t known to promise at our wedding.
</div>

<div>
  it was an amazingly emotional, unplanned moment.
</div>

<div>
  it rejuvenated our partnership, and it didn&#8217;t cost a penny.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  and tonight&#8217;s happy hour, food & all, cost us $14 (plus tip).
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  it just goes to show us that spouses can make cheap dates & awesome passion-igniting partners.
