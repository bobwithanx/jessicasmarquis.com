it&#8217;s been a long, hard week.

<div>
  lots of driving & busyness,
</div>

<div>
  mixed with trying to settle emotions stirred up by all the activity.
</div>

<div>
  i don&#8217;t tend to be an extremely emotional person,
</div>

<div>
  so enduring emotional upheaval is a true test of patience for me.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  but this unsettlement within me allowed me a window into something i rarely examine:
</div>

<div>
  i was able to tune into how i feel about events, behaviors, etc.
</div>

<div>
  typically, i&#8217;d make a quick decision about the situation & move on,
</div>

<div>
  but being in this emotional place gave me an entirely different vantage point.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  for example,
</div>

<div>
  things that annoy me usually just get ignored by me,
</div>

<div>
  but by checking into the feelings being triggered i could understand <i>why</i> i was annoyed.
</div>

<div>
  my body was trying to give me messages to help me.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  so this past week i learned to be a better listener to myself.
</div>

<div>
  by working to know my feelings,
</div>

<div>
  i can take on a new p.o.v. to open myself up to new possibilities.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  i mean, what&#8217;s passion without some emotion?
