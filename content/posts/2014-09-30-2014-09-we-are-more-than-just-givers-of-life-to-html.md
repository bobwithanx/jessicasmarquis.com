We are more than just the givers of life to our children. We form their templates of who women are & how they should act &#8211; & demand to be treated. We introduce them to the beginning of their values, worldview, & the authenticity of what we claim to believe.

Be in consistent community &#8211; church, Bible study, Christian friendships, etc &#8211; that supports what you want to instill. I grew up with fairly healthy messages about Jesus & Christian living in my home, but the summer Bible camps & youth group I attended were more conservative & legalistic & sent a lot of damaging messages I&#8217;ve had to learn to undo by God&#8217;s grace.

As we work to train up our children in the way they should go, let&#8217;s pray & strive to make sure the messages they&#8217;re getting outside the home from fellow Jesus-followers reinforce that training instead of dismantle it.
