i find it funny that i have to ask myself if i want to go deeper with God.  
shouldn&#8217;t the answer be an automatic & resounding &#8220;YES!&#8221;?  
yet i realize that such a decision creates consequences elsewhere:  
going deeper denotes excavation,  
and excavation causes other areas to get stirred up & disrupted.  
see the helpful flowchart below:

going deeper &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;> knocking my ducks out of a row

i work really hard to get my stuff settled.  
i don&#8217;t like having to start over again.  
call it laziness, i call it&#8230;yep, laziness works.

someone once said,  
&#8220;some people say, &#8216;Jesus came along & took my life & got it all straightened out.&#8217;  
that&#8217;s not what happened to me.  
i had everything where i wanted it, and He came along & shook it all up!&#8221;

that&#8217;s what going deeper with Him requires:  
regular shake-ups.  
not settling.

and when i feel that tug on my heart of the Spirit wanting to show me something new,  
i instinctively go into the pro-con list to evaluate if i can risk learning it at this point.

i&#8217;m working to realize it&#8217;s not about me &#8220;risking&#8221; to learn.  
it&#8217;s about me being ready to say, &#8220;yes Lord,&#8221; whenever He shows up.  
cuz He cares less about my duck rows & more about me never settling with where i am.
