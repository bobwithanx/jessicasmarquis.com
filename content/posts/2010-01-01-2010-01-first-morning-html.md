i awoke today refreshed & excited to get started on the next 52 weeks.

<div>
  first question to myself:
</div>

<div>
  &#8220;how can i be more passionate today?&#8221;
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  and i found this is harder to answer than i thought.
</div>

<div>
  great idea, frustratingly nebulous execution.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  so i&#8217;m trying something i don&#8217;t usually do, just to stir things up.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <i>i&#8217;m listing 5 things i&#8217;m grateful for this morning.</i>
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  1. <b>sunshine</b>, bright & warm with a promise of high 60-degree temps today. i missed out on this for the first 3 decades of my life; i won&#8217;t take it for granted.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  2. <b>mountains </b>that interrupt the horizon & display drastic textures that mess with the resulting shadows.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  3. <b>colors </b>that clash & blend & harmonize.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  4. <b>the potential of the next 24 hours. </b>with no school & no work on my schedule, i can make this day whatever i want.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  5. <b>hugs from 1 husband & 2 cats. </b>and i won&#8217;t complain about the cat hair today.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;m already feeling more energized.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  good morning, 2010.
