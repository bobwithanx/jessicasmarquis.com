spent last weekend in a screenwriting workshop.

<div>
  this is a passion i&#8217;ve put off for a while.
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;ve dabbled here & there,
</div>

<div>
  but i wouldn&#8217;t allow myself to dive in.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  with bob&#8217;s encouragement, i did it.
</div>

<div>
  it was a huge time & $ commitment,
</div>

<div>
  but it was worth it.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  i stretched.
</div>

<div>
  i was uncomfortable.
</div>

<div>
  i was creative.
</div>

<div>
  and now there is no turning back.
</div>

<div>
  to have that kind of opportunity & not do anything with it is ungrateful & unwise.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  <i>this year, passion is about seeking out deferred opportunities & acting upon them.</i>
</div>

<div>
  right now, i&#8217;m just feeling out a script concept,
</div>

<div>
  but that won&#8217;t be where it ends.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  please hold me to that. ðŸ˜‰
