i find it fascinating that this is a season of both   
gladness   
&   
sorrow. 

for some, there is gratitude for the gift of life & the opportunity to share all that it means.  
for others, there is dread of the stress & sense of inadequacy the commercialized holidays bring out.  
for even others, there is a depression that sets in from loss, loneliness, & lethargy.

to reduce/eliminate the holiday blues,  
we don&#8217;t send Christmas cards.  
we don&#8217;t have a brag-worthy nativity scene (we don&#8217;t have one at all, actually).  
we do decorate with lots of light.  
we don&#8217;t go to every holiday party we&#8217;re invited to if we&#8217;re tired or just need time alone.  
we do have candles & scents that remind us that this is a special time.  
we do make time to connect with others & share our thankfulness.

we only include elements into our celebration that make this a joyous occasion.

i want to wish everyone blessings during this month of hope,  
and rest amongst the insanity.

breathe in the color,  
transcend the chaos,  
and feel the deep calm that the Gift of Christmas brings to us.

peace.
