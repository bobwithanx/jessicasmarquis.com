Setting boundaries probably won&#8217;t feel great at first, and the other person probably won&#8217;t like them. And that is exactly why we need to trust the Spirit to give us discernment & strength, and surround ourselves with healthy people who will keep us on our path to wholeness! (Proverbs 13:20, Hebrews 10:25)

So, how do you set them? Boundaries can be reactive: &#8220;You&#8217;ve crossed the line, now back off!&#8221; But to be healthy & live God&#8217;s love, we need to move to proactive boundaries: &#8220;Here&#8217;s where the line is, so I&#8217;ll give you a friendly heads-up when you&#8217;re within 50 feet of it.&#8221; (Romans 12:18)

By the way, just as we teach our kiddos boundaries & respect through how to say no & hear no, we need to practice saying & hearing no in our own lives. Our little ones learn from what we tell them, but they also learn from what they see. (Proverbs 22:6)
