As inspiring as it is to hear about God&#8217;s forgiveness toward drug addicts & murderers, how atheists can do a 180 & serial adulterers can experience fulfillment in the redemptive love of Jesus, these stories can also isolate us. They can make us think, &#8220;I&#8217;m not _that_ bad &#8211; why would God waste His massive, precious grace on someone who just cheats a bit on her taxes or had sex with her boyfriend in high school or secretly judges others for their parenting styles?&#8221;

As small as those things may sound, to God they&#8217;re flashing neon signs of pride. Whenever we fall into the trap of thinking we should be able to fix our low-level sins, that our Lord doesn&#8217;t have time or interest in our moderate flaws, we are discounting what Jesus did on the cross.

Listen: We can&#8217;t all have earth-shattering testimonies. And we shouldn&#8217;t &#8211; most people can&#8217;t relate to them! So let&#8217;s purpose today to own our sins as sins, no matter their size, and accept that our loving Daddy&#8217;s grace is just the right size to cover them.

My name is Jessica, and God forgave me for complaining about my boss & coworkers. And He&#8217;s helping me to learn how to use my words to give life instead of spreading disease.
