the first time someone informed me of what &#8220;dirty rags&#8221; translated to in the Bible, it freaked me out.  
and i felt really bad about all i was trying to do.  
i was one of those kids who liked to work hard & make others proud.  
all-american.  
good work ethic.

and then i find out that God doesn&#8217;t care about that stuff.

shoot.

i wanted so badly to win His favor with my smart thinkin&#8217;, elbow grease, & lovableness,  
but i come find out He just wanted me to LET GO of my need to earn His favor.  
because i already have it.

but how could that be?  
and why was it that when i DID try to win Him over things got all the more difficult?

it&#8217;s taken me a lot of tries &#8212;  
probably in the triple digits by now &#8212;  
to not try.

today, i caught myself coming up with yet another plan to make God like me & make myself more usable for Him.  
the dirty rags were piling up.  
yet He&#8217;s so patient, isn&#8217;t He?

my prayer is that i let go of my need to act & earn,  
and that i let my loving God direct me into the work He has for me.  
that i act in His guidance & grace, not my own drive.

at some point, i gotta admit it:  
i&#8217;m no good when i go in with my own agenda.  
i guess i might as well make that confession today.
