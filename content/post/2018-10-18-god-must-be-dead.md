“I think God is dead.”

His little voice was decisive, like he had solved a math problem. The pump administering his medication whirred in the background while I gazed at my 3-year-old son’s moonlit face. I smoothed his hair, careful not to catch the NG tube as my hand drifted down to cradle his cheek.

“Why do you think that?” I asked him with a soft smile.

“I don’t see God, so God must be dead.”

I wondered how many people in the rooms around us had come to that same conclusion, possibly even while staying in this hospital. The reasoning made sense - how could someone believe an entity was alive if they found no evidence to prove so?

What troubled me as I considered my son’s theory wasn’t his inquiry or conclusion, but that, in some situations, such an observation could be met with penalty. He may have been corrected, his logic invalidated, by well-meaning but zealous adherents. I knew this from experience. When I questioned, I was met with an unequivocal, line-in-the-sand answer instead of open space. Through this, I received the message that I could not arrive in my time at truth that I could own and operate from. It was like getting hand-me-downs that didn’t fit, versus discovering my personal superhero suit. One I had to squeeze into while wasting energy in constantly adjusting and feeling awkward, and the other allowed me to change the world while co-creating with a greater power.

A lot of people who mentor others - whether in faith or other matters - try to give the right path without providing alternatives. “Here’s how to do it. Don’t look at other options, because they are wrong.” It may seem efficient and helpful, but it actually deprives the student from life lessons, from arriving at truth they comprehend and embody. It also assumes the mentor knows everything, and there aren’t other possibilities. It instills fear and blind loyalty, not curiosity and grace.

When I was in college, a Christian friend confronted me regarding my decision to attend a university that was not Christian. I responded that my priority was a full education, not one that came from a singular point of view. Also, I attended a Jesuit university - a Catholic institution. The second point was lost on him, though, as his tradition taught that these siblings in faith were not actually Christians. Again, one perspective provided, and he followed without exploration. (Last I heard, he’d become an atheist.)

I placed that previous sentence in parentheses, but I’d like to expand on it because it contains so many mental hyperlinks for me. I am close friends with a lot of ex-Christians, who now classify themselves as agnostic, atheist, or N/A. Their stories are full of pain and exclusion, of wonder that was squelched and reasoning that wasn’t welcomed, of abuse and neglect, of rules that replaced love, of lonely dead ends, of withering belief from the harsh light of hypocrisy. I don’t know any who were encouraged to be smart and inquisitive and flawed and unique and revolutionary who hold bitterness toward their religious origins.

It’s that old adage: If you love something, set it free. If your goal is to keep someone in a relationship, you don’t restrain them. As humans, the more limits are placed on us - of which we are aware - the more likely we are to cast them all off and abandon the entire mess.

What I’m _not_ suggesting, so please don’t misunderstand me, is to avoid teaching and guiding those entrusted into our care. That’s abdicating our responsibility. We can and should provide them with guidelines and values. But when they investigate outside of such fences, we must not lock the gate and tell them to stay out there. If we provide guilt or shame to them, we teach them that curiosity is wrong, that the brain God gave them needs to be shut down. Shame, after all, is not a tool of restoration but of alienation.

I looked at my kiddo, his thoughtful eyes dimming as sleep approached. “I can see why you think God is dead. Want to know what I believe?” I asked.

“Yeah.”

“I believe God is everywhere. God lives differently from you and me. God is my Mama, just like I’m your mama, and she takes care of me when I’m sad and scared and happy. She loves to surround me with hugs. She is in the air, and in cold water, and in our love for each other. She is even in the medicine going through that tube to bring healing to your body.”

“God isn’t in a tube!” he said, laughing. I laughed with him and hugged him as I had described God hugging me.

“God is in the healing and the goodness,” I whispered. “And God is also with us in the bad. Even if we can’t see God. That’s what I believe.”

He didn’t counter, nor did he inquire further. I hadn’t provided my full theology, nor had I asked him to accept what I’d said. I simply showed him my superheroine suit, and I let him start finding his. I have no idea what it will look like, but I’m excited to see what he co-creates with it.
