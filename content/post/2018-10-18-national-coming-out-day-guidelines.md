Re: #NationalComingOutDay guidelines 🏳️‍🌈

1. Do not out anyone.

2. Do not urge anyone to come out if they aren’t ready &/or safe. And you do not get to decide if they’re ready &/or safe.

3. Do not “come out” as straight. It is not funny, no matter how hilarious it sounds in your head.

4. Do not come out as an ally. If you need to identify as an ally to defend the day against critics, please do so. But do not make the day about you. Come out another day.

5. Create space for your LGBTQ friends, family, & neighbors. You may be the only one in their circle who does.
