Lately, God has been speaking to me a lot about redemption. What a sweet word that is! What awesomeness to contemplate! Our loving Daddy grinds up all our poop into manure that grows beauty & life!&nbsp; 

We must share regularly with each other & with our kiddos about how God has redeemed us, all His mighty works in our _own_ lives. Psalm 78:5-8 talks about how these reminders will keep our children from becoming rebellious against God. What a gift to us both: Sharing God&#8217;s victories in our lives with them so they can learn & stay faithful, seeing His victories in their own lives!

Let&#8217;s tell each other the almighty works of our redemptive Daddy who is greater than our pasts & creates new futures out of poop!

~We will not hide them from their children,  
but tell to the coming generation  
the glorious deeds of the Lord, and his might,  
and the wonders that he has done.~  
Psalm 78:4
