know what&#8217;s great about God?  
He doesn&#8217;t expect superhumanism.  
when He says to get along with others, it&#8217;s always framed in a reasonable manner.  
He tells us to take breaks & get rest.  
and He only tells us to be peacemakers, not peacekeepers.  
i like following a proactive, reasonable, caring Deity.  
it makes me want to love Him back.  
and keep working at doing what He says,  
knowing He&#8217;ll accept me regardless of my imperfections.
