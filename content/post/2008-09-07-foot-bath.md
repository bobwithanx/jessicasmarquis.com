i am fascinated by the thought of Jesus washing feet.  
regardless of cultural tradition & symbolism, i just love that this Guy cared SO MUCH about the other guys He hung out with that He took on one of the stinkiest parts of the male body.  
that is LOVE.

but here&#8217;s the kicker &#8212;  
He tells them that He has to wash all their feet to include them in what He was doing.  
(i&#8217;m sure judas was plenty perturbed by that thought.)  
see, Jesus wanted them to feel what it is like to be honored by one who does not need to do so.

because that was their assignment after He left.

in reading this story, it has nudged me to think about ways i can wash others&#8217; feet.  
i&#8217;m not all that into the act of it, so i&#8217;m sticking with the symbolism of it:  
showing humble love & respect toward another.  
it&#8217;s a bit more personal than tossing an extra $1 into the make-a-wish jar at the store.

so i guess i&#8217;m on a quest to become a human foot bath.
