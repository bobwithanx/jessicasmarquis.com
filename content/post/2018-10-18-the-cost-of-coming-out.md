Right now, people are counting the relationships they’re about to lose. They’re cutting ties with places where they’ll no longer feel welcome, and coming up with alternatives to activities and positions from which they may have to resign. Some may be looking for new roommates or entirely new places to live. Some may be in touch with counselors and carrying suicide help line numbers in their pockets.

For these individuals, coming out comes with a cost. Still they prepare themselves, hopefully surrounded by a support group, as they anticipate #NationalComingOutDay on October 11.

If enduring the pain described above is preferable, we can only imagine the agony in which they have been existing.

In Amber Cantorna's memoir [_Refocusing My Family_](https://www.amazon.com/Refocusing-My-Family-Coming-Discovering/dp/1506418791), she describes what it was like to finally come out as a lesbian to her parents. Here, her mother is distraught and angry about the announcement:

"'It's extremely selfish of you to do something that makes you happy without thinking about how this would affect the family.' I couldn't believe she was serious. How this would affect the family is _all_ I'd thought about for months leading up to this conversation."

Amber now runs Beyond, an organization to help LGBTQ people in their coming out process. Why is this necessary? Because disclosing one’s sexuality or gender identity to those who do not support it is hard…and can be dangerous. According to research from various sources I’ve collected, members of the LGBTQ community:

\-Report significantly higher rates of physical and verbal assault than heterosexual peers

\-Are 3-6 times more likely to self harm than their heterosexual peers.

\-Are almost 5 times more likely to attempt suicide than their heterosexual peers. (In particular, 32-50% of trans individuals attempt suicide at least once during their lifetimes.)

\-If coming from a highly rejecting family, are 8.4 more likely to attempt suicide than their LGB peers who come from families with little to no rejection.

So, every October 11, LGBTQ individuals get to identify themselves as such - sometimes for the first time ever. They have the opportunity to break the silence so they do not have to live in shame, always carrying the fear of who will find out, when, and how. They proceed with the freedom to be who they are, even though that may bring derision, loss of status, and - in some cases - attacks.

Why am I telling you this? Because if you're a fellow straight cisgendered person who lucked out genetically through _no_ action of your own, you probably don't think about the value of October 11. Please do. Please celebrate your courageous friends, family, & acquaintances. Please shut down the dissenting voices, the harsh criticism, and do your part to create safe space for LGBTQ people in your orbit to experience the victory of coming out.

LASTLY, if you are an ally who has not “outed” yourself, IT. IS. TIME. Your silence is harming those you support. If you need a pep talk to do the right - and inconvenient - thing, check out my [guest post](https://www.betweencommunities.com/blog/2017/10/1/ministry-leader-and-closeted-ally?fbclid=IwAR0fM4iuPkqbr_z9OwaENSA6nJzkOpBfqu3mn6uioh58vCdlKUXQgKTvqP8) on Austin Hodges Pierce's _Between Communities_ blog.

The countdown is on, my friends. Congratulations in advance to those who will be wholly claiming their identity for the first time.
