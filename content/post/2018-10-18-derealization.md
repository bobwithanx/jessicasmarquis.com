I recently discovered a word for which I’d been searching 30 years. I owned a thesaurus, a dictionary, and an encyclopedia from the 1960s (the last of which proved dreadfully unhelpful - nay, detrimental). Through this trio, I learned a lot about adverbs, adjectives, and old-timey gadgets, but not about the word I needed.

The word I finally found was “derealization”. While typically coupled with “depersonalization”, I’m more familiar with it from its single life. Sorry, depersonalization, there’s nothing here for you. Go grab a drink while derealization and I chat.

Before I go any further, I want to be straight with you all: This isn’t a confessional booth for me. I’ve already processed this so I can bring it to you raw but not bleeding. It’s rare to medium rare. Still, if this seems like oversharing, that is because I want to share with you and the details spill over. So I guess that’s _technically_ oversharing. But I don’t mean it in a voyeuristic way. You can go find that kind of thing elsewhere, like Youtube or a teen’s blog.

If you haven’t yet googled “derealization”, I’ll wait. Done? If it sounds familiar to your experiences, take this [brief assessment](http://www.strangerinthemirror.com/questionnaire.html). (This isn’t the point of my post, but I wanted to connect you with a resource now if this hits home with you, so you can focus on what I’m really getting at.)

I’ve wondered since I was in elementary school if life was a grand prank. I’ve interacted with my surroundings as if I’m decked out in Saran Wrap. I told my doctor at age 8, “I feel like I’m in a dream.” He did some examinations, and I had some MRIs, an EEG, and a CT scat over the following years, but they proved inconclusive. Thus, I was labeled “fine”. I adjusted to my reality, and after a few decades I don’t have any lingering anxiety about it. This is simply how my life is.

Now that I have a word, though, my approach to life doesn’t seem so odd. I feel validated and less isolated, knowing others experience this phenomenon. It makes sense that it comes from trauma and from accidents; I’ve had both. This isn’t the place to go into those, since I’ve already built a high-rise of multiple paragraphs. I will go into them eventually, though; I promise.

The purpose of my post isn’t to educate you on dissociation or my weird brain that continually fascinates me. My intention is that you reflect on the stuff happening in your mind/body/spirit that you think only you experience, that you’ve likely kept secret. Got something? I can guarantee it isn’t just you. Look up the symptoms. Describe the experience. I uncovered dozens of articles, as well as legit DSM-5 and ICD 10 diagnoses for my thing. Others have found support groups and Subreddits devoted to their particular topics. While these discoveries don’t fix our situations, they've helped us better accept ourselves and set our course by integrating the stuff that sticks out.

If you aren’t sure how to do these kinds of searches for resources, email me. Manage your expectations now: I won’t have the answer. I’m severely lacking in the omniscience department. But I’m happy to accompany you in getting on track to find your path, whatever it is.

Listen: You aren’t stupid or crazy. You may have used those words to describe yourself in the past to dismiss your unique quirks, mysterious dysfunctions, and incomprehensible giftedness. It’s a game so many of us - particularly women - play to pass as “normal”. Screw that. Normal is a construct no flawed human can attain. Dig deep and know yourself.

You are too important to be anonymous.
