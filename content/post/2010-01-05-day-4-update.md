bob has climbed aboard my attempt to mix it up, and we went on our own adventure tonight.

  in the 4+ years we&#8217;ve been together, i&#8217;m not sure we&#8217;ve ever &#8220;gone out for a drink&#8221;.

  tonight, we took a break from our schedules,

  claimed a happy hour,

  & descended on <a href="http://www.sidebarphoenix.com/">sidebar</a>.


  we sat on a couch in a dimly lit upstairs bar with no more than 10 other people,

  an old kung-fu movie playing on various flat-screens around us.

  we sipped wine & brainstormed on upcoming projects,

  much like we had when we were dating.

  we flirted like we weren&#8217;t married.


  <i>married passion in its most basic form.</i>


  the other night, we privately &#8220;renewed our vows&#8221; by simply promising all the things we hadn&#8217;t known to promise at our wedding.

  it was an amazingly emotional, unplanned moment.

  it rejuvenated our partnership, and it didn&#8217;t cost a penny.


  and tonight&#8217;s happy hour, food & all, cost us $14 (plus tip).


  it just goes to show us that spouses can make cheap dates & awesome passion-igniting partners.
