it&#8217;s tough to keep track of what i depend on.  
i have a list of plans:  
plan a, plan b, plan c&#8230;  
always something to back up the plan preceding it so i don&#8217;t feel &#8220;out of control&#8221;.

but these plans are really only illusions,  
and this gets shoved in my face as often as God remembers to show love to me.

He doesn&#8217;t like me depending on anything other than Him,   
and rightly so:  
there is nothing outside of Him that can stand on its own.

when i trust in something that lacks a proven perfect track record &#8212;  
which seems to be everything, last i checked  
&#8212; i set myself up to be let down.

my Daddy disciplines those He loves.  
not just when we mess up, but when we need to learn self-discipline.  
the fruit of the Spirit, self-control.  
He loves me & hurts when i choose another thing to lean on.  
something inferior to Him.  
how illogical to lean on something less dependable, eh?

so today i&#8217;m declaring that i&#8217;m going to put my trust in what works.  
want to join me?  
(hint: it&#8217;s not money or career.)
