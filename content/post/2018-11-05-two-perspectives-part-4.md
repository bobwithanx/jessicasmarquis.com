'Twas the night before Election

And all through cyberspace

Opinions were shouted

And forced in my face.

If you can relate with my intro (YES! I WROTE THAT! CAN YOU BELIEVE ITâ€½), let's take a moment to look into each other's virtual eyes as humans. Let's breathe the same air and look at the same sun. No, stop, don't look at the sun. Just acknowledge we're all under the same sun. 

My #TwoPerspectives post on this Election Day Eve isn't going to be on a specific topic.* Rather, it's going to be on the cognitive dissonance we all encounter when voting. There are many ways to resolve this: Some have chosen not to vote because they can't reconcile that dissonance, some vote third party, some hold their nose and vote, saying, "This candidate is the lesser of two evils." I have done all three of those. On occasion, I have marked on the ballot with pride, pressing firmly with my blue or black ink pen to indicate how much I support the candidate.

Most of you can guess where I land politically, and I am entering this post with that bias. Nonetheless, I have the experience of being in every camp along the spectrum and researching them to be able to discuss them, which is the whole point of this series. I've already shared that I was a single-issue voter for many years, I voted Libertarian for a while, and now I'm voting on behalf of communities who have been historically marginalized and have had to operate at a disadvantage  - Black, Latinx, LGBTQ, disabled, Muslim, women, immigrants, and so on.  

It took me a long time to get here, and a huge key to that was becoming friends - \*real\* friends - with members of these communities. As long as they stayed theoretical figures, I didn't need to get involved in their needs and challenges. But once we each held a piece of one another's heart, I could no longer keep them at an intellectual distance. Love compelled me to overcome my personal barriers of using my vote for their good.

One pivotal point in this paradigm shift came in 2004, while I was at a missionary conference and having lunch with a new friend. She was in her 60s and retiring from serving for at least a decade in Africa. We discussed workshops and speakers, and then drifted into literature and culture. We hit upon the recent Presidential election, and her eyes got serious, her voice forceful: "What I want to know is who said it's a sin to vote Democrat?"

Now, I'd heard people my age say it, but here was a seasoned missionary and Christian mentor to many around the world lending her voice to this resounding rhetorical question. And she didn't backtrack. When I met up with her 12 years later, I mentioned how much I had appreciated her asking that during that time. "Yeah, that sounds like something I'd say," she said with a grin.

A lot of us from conservative white evangelical (CWE) faith traditions have the latent - sometimes blatant - belief that to vote for Democrats is un-Jesus-like. We don't want to risk our salvation, so we vote for the "right" candidate, the one who also supports policies and initiatives that will harm our neighbors. We justify it through a litany of talking points, but in our spirit we know something ain't right.

If this is you, please hear me: God wants you to use your mind and your heart in making these decisions. Many political positions have been pumped up as "Christian", but - as you've seen in previous posts in this series - the issues are much more complex. Please spend some time reacquainting yourself with Jesus by reading the gospels tonight; I especially recommend Matthew 23 and Luke 11. You may be surprised by where Jesus' priorities laid! (Hint: not with religious leaders or politicians or religious leaders who were involved in politics.

Lastly, while I was working on this post, an article was shared by two friends (thanks Amy & Kathy!), so it wiggled to the top of my timeline. If you have 15 minutes and the heart-space to read it, it puts a lot of what I'm saying into [one family's narrative](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2018/11/05/republican-pro-life-health-care-family-support-column/1837701002/?fbclid=IwAR1zC5aJpyAW_0iPuDh0dlDW1ZOvaPWe0l4Y1cMs7vYiySuxhiyg4B35Iak). Consider it a type of parable.

Thank you for walking with me on this path. Blessings as you seek to reconcile your cognitive dissonance for tomorrow's vote.
