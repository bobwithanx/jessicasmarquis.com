As I’ve shared about my tidal wave of depression crested with anxiety, many people have come forward with similar stories. I’ve been audience to tales of phone calls to counselors never returned, shame over being a human who breaks sometimes, and fears of taking medication that affects the brain. Even as a former therapist, I’m not an expert on these things, so I often respond with, “Yep, it sucks.” And a hug. You know, if the person’s cool with that.

I can’t count how many people tell me they got up the courage to call a mental health professional, then became discouraged because they couldn’t get an appointment. Even if that number was one caller, it's too high. When a person arrives at the point of asking for outside help, it's a huge deal. If this is your story, you did the right thing by reaching out. Don’t feel like you’re a failure, or that no one wants to be with you in the journey. The sad fact is the journey to begin the journey - the pre-game, I guess - sometimes takes extra footwork. But once you’re en route, it’s worth it.

What I really want to address here, though, is medication. Maybe I buried the lede on this, but I wanted to make sure I got the affirmation out of the way so people will devote one hour tomorrow to getting back on the phone and making an intake appointment.

I’ve been host to a depression/anxiety combo since at least age 11, the age of training bras and being handed that first stick of deodorant. I’ve been in and out of counseling throughout my life, and it has helped a great deal. However, when I was pregnant with the twins in my 30s, my chemistry went haywire and I couldn’t get it under control through usual coping skills. It was my first time taking an antidepressant, and I experienced immediate relief. Fortunately, I seemed to have no side effects; there may have been, but I was preoccupied with the greater discomfort of carrying two aspiring kick-boxers.

I’m now back on the same SSRI (Lexapro), as well as an additional antidepressant (Wellbutrin). We had upped the Lexapro dose, but that wasn’t enough on its own. This doesn’t necessarily mean that I’m more depressed or anxious than someone else, but rather that my body needs something more. There are a lot of factors here - metabolism, genetics, etc. Some people don’t do well on one or both of these meds, and some see changes soon afterward. Again, I’m only sharing my own anecdotal experience. And I’m doing this because I didn’t have a lot of info about what it feels like to be on psychotropics, other than accounts of people on heavier meds in situations to which I could not relate.

Lexapro takes 6-8 weeks to take full effect, so it’s a gradual change. I didn’t wake up one day and bound out of bed. It was more like this: 

\-During the first week, I wasn’t crying every day. 

\-By the second week, I didn’t feel like I was falling without a bottom. 

\-By the third week, I felt some energy and hope. Not happiness, but no longer hopelessness. I still kept myself off social media and away from situations that required extraversion, and that helped in my improvement. 

\-After 8 weeks, I wasn’t feeling arbitrary surges of panic, but rather small sparks that were quickly snuffed out. The anxiety and depression weren’t gone, but rather minimized to a stress I could manage and a trickle of blunted emotions. I knew I could do better - I’d felt better before - so my doctor and I chatted and she prescribed the additional med. I’m early on with it, so I can’t say much yet, but I’m not feeling as meh.

The path has not been a smooth incline. Changing doses has resulted in weird emotional reactions, but after a while they've subsided. I don’t feel like the people in the Kids in the Hall film ‘Brain Candy’, zombie-blissful and unresponsive. I feel like me returning to myself. I know what that \*can\* feel like, and I believe I will get back there. I also believe that maybe I can get beyond that, since I’ve always had an undercurrent of anxiety and depression. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t want to banish them forever. Those companions have served me well to examine life and connect with others. But they’ve also gotten in the way of me doing those things, and that is what I want to prevent.

I hope some of this writing brings peace or encouragement for you. If you’re considering therapy, do it. I’m rooting for you, and you can email me if you need resources. (Note: I’m still not on Facebook regularly to check comments or PM’s.) If you’re considering medication, talk to your doctor. Remember: Neither counseling nor meds are a sign of weakness, but rather that you want to function better. One day you may not need one or both, but today you may. That’s okay. Be good to you so you can share your unique light with the world…in time.
