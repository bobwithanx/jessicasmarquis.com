Last night, I had a pretty scary reaction due to a medication/pregnancy hormone interaction, and it threw one more grievance on top of my massive pile of maternity issues. But what I&#8217;ve found to be most effective in combating the vacuum of self-pity isn&#8217;t Tylenol or ginger essential oil or urgent calls to my midwife. It&#8217;s gratitude. It&#8217;s trust my loving Daddy is sovereign & is always with me & using this all to His glory.

Some of you may know about the heart-altering dream I had in my early twenties about embracing family life; needless to say, Daddy grabbed my attention at a place & time when I couldn&#8217;t escape Him, and He gave me a glimpse of the joy of motherhood to whet my taste for it &#8211; for the first time ever.

Today, I get to constantly experience the indescribable love & satisfaction of being a mom, and I owe it all to Him. He knew what I needed then, and how to get a stubborn me to it. So I am practicing gratitude & faith that He will get me to the next point, regardless of what trials stand in the way.
