Today may not be the happiest Thanksgiving for some of us, and our loving Daddy knows that. So let&#8217;s challenge ourselves today to be grateful & give praise in the midst of our current trials, trusting Him that next year&#8217;s Thanksgiving might just be spent in gratitude for what He brought out of this season.

~His purpose for our trials is often to bring us humbly before Him to experience a breaking in our inner, independent, self-sufficient selves, and grow us up into compassionate, patient, spiritually strong, God-glorifying people.~
