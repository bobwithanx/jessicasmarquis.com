why would someone who is allergic to cottonwood consider it a blessing?  
that&#8217;s what i asked in order to get this exclusive interview&#8230;with myself.

Q: what&#8217;s the story behind the title?

A: i was on a walk in my neighborhood several years ago, frustrated with the pain i was in & my perception of God&#8217;s lack of intervention. i kept chasing after His approval & His gifts, and i came up empty-handed. i am a recovering type A, so this was not a pleasing result to me. as i argued with the Lord on this walk, i saw a cottonwood fluff float by me. i grabbed at it&#8230;& missed. bad aim. i tried again, closing my fist around the target. i opened it. empty.

Q: i think we get the picture.

A: well, i didn&#8217;t. i was a bit too steeped in my own anger & hurt to think clearly, and i kept on chasing that fluff & grabbing at it. every time, i ended up with nothing.

Q: did you give up?

A: technically, yes. i reached a cul de sac, and i had to turn around. i was so upset at this point; nothing i was striving for was coming to me. and then i started to walk with the wind to my back, not reaching for the fluffs &#8212; and a shower of them landed on me. i didn&#8217;t even have to open my hands to grasp them. it was like God was saying, &#8220;I will provide. cease striving, my child.&#8221;

Q: did you?

A: it took some practice (it still does), but i&#8217;m getting better. with the help of the One who makes the cottonwood, of course. i&#8217;m learning to rest and trust that He will bring the right blessings by His grace & in His time.
