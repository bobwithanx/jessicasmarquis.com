“So what do I do now?” Ugh, that unwelcome question. I’m way too familiar with it, an uninvited guest who lingers forever and keeps giving me a knowing glance. 

Once I’d dissected and released my BOA stance, I unexpectedly found myself politically homeless. Simply put, I no longer had a way to vote. The way I’d been voting involved picking up the election guide in my church’s lobby, flipping through the pages, and locating names of candidates marked “Pro-Life”. That did it. It’s called being a “single-issue voter”, and I unabashedly fit the profile. 

Not that I liked being told what to think, but in this area…I guess it was somehow okay. Even proof of my faith. It allowed me to save time from researching candidates and issues; I just had to mark the names on my ballot who didn’t agree with killing babies. I had no shame in this; I figured that someone who opposed killing babies must have several other values in common with me. 

Following that logic, those who didn’t oppose killing babies (which I translated to be _for_ killing babies) must be devious, duplicitous, and destructive. 

Nothing in my community challenged this assumption. In fact, a lot of people, news sources, and organizations around me aggressively advocated for it. 

Okay, so when I first typed the preceding paragraph, the second sentence struck me like a grand embellishment. Then I received a letter from an organization promoting itself as “Christian,” and it proved my memories disturbingly correct. Check out [my analysis of it](http://www.jessicasmarquis.com/post/2018-10-21-boa-letter-markup/), reviewing and correcting inaccuracies and misleading information.

Downgrading my primary voting issue and adjusting my position from BOA to “It’s complicated,” I began searching for other issues to vote upon - and then researching about those issues, because, well, issues are complicated.

My friends, I will shoot straight with you: It sucked.

As a White person, I had no societal issues I needed addressed. As a woman in the conservative White evangelical (CWE) church, I’d been told I didn’t have rights I needed to protect. Thus, I didn’t want to be political. I didn’t want to hold divisive opinions. I didn’t want to delve into unfamiliar territories that caused me to view myself as uninvolved, inadequate, ignorant, and indifferent. It was so much easier to tie myself to a noble cause, appearing both informed and exemplary. 

This was when I encountered the following passage:

> “Speak out for those who cannot speak, for the rights of all the destitute. Speak out, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.” Proverbs 31:8-9

I had seriously lagged on most of that.

A comment from a stranger pulled this whole mess together. In that sticky and ugly political season, this white dude confessed he didn’t like any of the candidates. As a result, he was using his vote for whomever his marginalized friends supported. He wanted his vote to help them.

Reading his conclusion, I felt like an idiot. That had been the right answer all along. I needed to listen to my neighbors in need. I needed to use my voice and my vote if either of them could make a difference. 

Know why I hadn’t? Because it cost me nothing to only stand for one thing, something for which I made no personal sacrifice. It was the same reason I went on mission trips to other states instead of my own city and gave money to global justice initiatives instead of local ones. I had a buffer. I wasn’t personally affected. Listening to my neighbors affected me, costing me time and pushing me out of my comfort zone. It even required me to be political so their needs might be met. 

If this quandary sounds familiar, I’m going to ask you: What do you do now? 

If you aren’t sure, take a slice of my hard-won experience for yourself. First, recognize this is an opportunity for you to be a good neighbor, a contributing part of the human community. From there, you have a variety of options:

1. Determine a cause that pulls at your heart, not because of a narrative you’ve been given but because it is something _you_ know. Maybe it’s poverty, or lack of resources in public education, or limited access to healthcare, or unhealthy drinking water, or domestic violence. Here’s a pro-tip: Look for something happening within your state - bonus points if it’s happening within your city.
2. Ask a friend from a marginalized population - People of Color, women, the disabled, LGBTQ, a religion outside of Christianity, family of the incarcerated, etc. - what matters to them in this election. Learn why. Find candidates who address these issues directly.
3. Read, read, read. Local newspapers, court reports, candidate websites, transcripts of debates. This is especially important for local elections, because they are what impact you immediately. _That_ is where you have some legit voice and influence.

I want to urge you again to [read the letter I’ve analyzed](http://www.jessicasmarquis.com/post/2018-10-21-boa-letter-markup/). It hurt to examine it and see how an organization that had previously served as an authority to me communicated with such suspicion and deception. We need to do better, my friends. BOA or WCA, we need to do better.

Thank you for joining me in this journey. I’m convincing myself to get rather personal in a future installment of #TwoPerspectives, so I need to go prepare for that. 

I love you all. Happy researching!
