three-day weekends throw me for a loop.

  when i was younger, a day off meant VACATION!

  now, it means having more time for organizing, errand-running, & homework.

  my to-do list for today looks nothing like a passion-igniter.


  but yesterday&#8217;s message at our church certainly was.


  after talking about how our small expectations can get in the way of God actually creating something awesome &#8212;

  or, at least, get in the way of us appreciating it

  &#8212; pastor john challenged us to consider some questions during reflection time.

  the last one was the one that got me:


  <i>what &#8220;small&#8221; dream do you need to kill off to make way for the big plans God has for you?</i>


  ouch.


  i am notorious for planning first, then asking God what He thinks later.

  and my dreams are often selfish.


  so to be faced with a question asking what artery-clogging agent i am clinging to that is keeping the blood flowing to the right places&#8230;

  well, needless to say i had an unexpected, uncomfortable about-face right then & there.


  it&#8217;s contradictory to say,

  &#8220;i believe God has the best in mind for me,&#8221;

  then go make my own plans & get angry at Him when He intervenes.

  and my passion is squelched when i take it all into my own hands.


  so i used the reflection time to do some serious open heart surgery.

  i want those arteries cleaned out so my heart pumps clearly & in rhythm with Daddy&#8217;s song for my life.


  today, amongst the errand-running & such,

  i&#8217;m making time to offer up dreams for the killing.

  i know if He takes one, He&#8217;ll replace it with something better.


  He always has & always will.

  and He is where true passion starts.
