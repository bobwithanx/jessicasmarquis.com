In my mind, there are two types of comedy shows: The kind that build a cohesive storyline throughout the episodes, and the kind where each episode is its own story. I&#8217;m sure they have industry terms, but I don&#8217;t want to stop my brain dump to research them. Let&#8217;s just call the former _Arrested Development_ and the latter _The Simpsons_.

If you watch an episode of _Arrested Development_ and then jump ahead a few episodes, you may be confused by why the lawyer is a different guy, or find yourself asking what happened to Marta or Gob&#8217;s puppet Franklin or Charlize Theron and her fantastic fashions. However, you can go for years without watching an episode of _The Simpsons_ and have no glitches upon reentry. I know &#8211; I&#8217;ve tried it. 

I say all this to explain that I default to a perspective on my spiritual growth that is more _The Simpsons_ than _Arrested Development._ My Teacher leads me into a new truth, and I marvel at it and may even apply it, then file it away for posterity. A while later &#8211; perhaps even a _short_ while later &#8211; I&#8217;m given a chance to apply it in a new way, and I&#8217;ve completely forgotten the truth.

My husband often remarks at my repeated revelations: &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you learn this before? I remember you telling me about this already.&#8221; And each time, I look at him blankly for a bit, then start to recall the episode of my life to which he&#8217;s referring.

It only makes sense that the Designer of the circulatory system and photosynthesis and outer space would also have a design for our individualized spiritual curriculum, especially if we&#8217;re attentive students. So why do I keep going back to square one when faced with a new challenge?

The most recent example of this occurred a few days ago, when I was reflecting on my current season of life. It&#8217;s no secret that I have three young children, and the common thinking seems to be a mom in my situation is exempted from service outside the home. This doesn&#8217;t jive with me; I have too little gifting in domestic living to spend all my energy there. But I had begun to resign myself to the idea that common thinking must be God&#8217;s thinking.

And then I stumbled across my birth story of the twins, which I wrote in 2015. Yes, one year ago. In it, I talked about how God isn&#8217;t interested in simply doing things the safe, established way. He likes risks and leaping out of the boxes we try to put Him in.

Smack!

As I pulled this truth rock out from where it had lodged itself between my eyes, I was saturated with excitement at the prospect that He had something adventurous (and probably unsafe) in store for my family. I relished the concept of taking action that matters &#8211; that also includes my kiddos.

I was also admittedly embarrassed that I needed a refresher course so soon after the initial lesson. But, hey, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll need it again, because my short-term memory loss is impeccable. And I&#8217;m so grateful I serve and am loved by a God who has grace with this glaring imperfection.
