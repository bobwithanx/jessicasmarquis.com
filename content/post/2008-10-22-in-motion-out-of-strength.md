i heard a comment today that really stuck with me:  
God doesn&#8217;t give strength to us when we&#8217;re in motion.

the context of this is NOT that God doesn&#8217;t help us when we have a lot going on.  
in fact, the person who said it remarked that God always makes sure we won&#8217;t run out of steam when we are under pressure.

the context of this statement IS that we need to be taking time to be still before God,  
taking time to listen to Him & accept His strength as He works within us.  
He doesn&#8217;t toss strength as us as we run from starbucks to our car while we&#8217;re on our cell phone.

our God is an intimate God.  
His strength comes from those focused, intimate moments together.
