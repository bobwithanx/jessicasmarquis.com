One of the great things in life is how we change & our interests evolve. This can be great for our marriages&#8230;or it can pull you apart if you don&#8217;t work to include one another in those developments. It&#8217;s so easy to believe the lie, &#8220;We just aren&#8217;t compatible anymore,&#8221; but that doesn&#8217;t jive with God&#8217;s definition of marriage. Growth in us can bring growth in our relationships when we don&#8217;t just focus on ourselves!

Do you feel like you&#8217;ve grown apart from your spouse? Take a moment to intentionally tune into his interests, and &#8211; even if he couldn&#8217;t care less about social psychology studies or babywearing or making your own cleaning products &#8211; God will honor your efforts and bring healing to you in His way & in His time.
