Have you ever had a thought, then shut it down because it seemed way too weird? I’m guessing you have, and that some of those thoughts are ones we’ve actually shared. So today I’m going to talk about grieving the loss of depression and anxiety.

WHAT‽ Who would want to rush back into the arms of disorder? It sounds preposterous, macabre, a dysfunctional relationship.

So I guess I’m a fool for dysfunctional love. (Just ask my journals prior to meeting Bob.)

See, as I glimpse healing, I hide more. The bare truth is, I’m scared to reenter “normal” life. I’ve been in this survival headspace for so long I can’t snap out of it. Or maybe I don’t want to. As the fog dissipates, I search for traces of it so I can immerse myself in the familiar. Going back to the one who done me wrong because we've got history.

During previous episodes of depression and/or anxiety, I wanted to break free. I wanted to feel happy and peaceful again. That’s what we’re supposed to want, right? We’re supposed to be thrilled to see an exit sign from this misery, then dash toward it, no looking back.

That isn’t what’s happening, though. This time I feel like letting go is dishonoring my pain. It had a right to exist; if I move on from it will that nullify it? I know in my mind the answer is no, but my heart isn't catching on.

When things don’t make sense, I get analytical. I go right into my head because that’s where I feel most at home. My counselor rolls her eyes at this, but that’s a whole other matter. ANYWAY, I asked myself, “Self, why aren’t you enthusiastic about this potential end to the yuck?” And my self, true to myself, answered directly:

I’m grieving the loss of who I’ve been - where I’ve been - for a long time. I’m scared of what awaits in the light.

That’s…well…that’s embarrassing. But it’s the truth. And now my imagination whisks me away to consider what it’s like for musicians and artists who have made their living as sad or manic or neurotic. What’s it like if they move toward wholeness? _Can_ they, if given the proper treatment protocol, caring professionals, and support circle? Do they want to? Or do they continue in the crap so they can remain authentic and consistent in their art?

Again, I reference the Kids in the Hall movie_ Brain Candy_, where a sullen rock star takes depression meds and changes his repertoire to cheery lyrics. His fans hate it. (Check out [“Happiness Pie”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5xZ2NTq3CU) if you want to see the ‘90s-psychedelic result.)

This all may seem like a tangent, but I wonder this because, if it’s hard for me as a stay-at-home mom and reporter on unicorns, it’s gotta be _so_ much harder for those whose identities are tied up with suffering.

I’m not applying a blanket contemplation. There are some who are unable to dismiss the dark cloud, others whose suffering is so severe they will never escape its reverberations, and others for whom contextual or health factors make this entire discussion a moot point. To them, I say this: 

I admire your perseverance. You are doing your very best with what you have and where you are, and I can see it. Thank you for being you.

But that isn’t my situation. I’m capable of moving out of this extended season of suckiness. It’s my reluctance that pulls me back. I know that adventure awaits me once I accept the invitation; first, though, I’ve got to grieve the comfort of melancholy, exhaustion, stress, and survival. By recognizing the routines I’ve come to rely upon, I can let them go and receive new ones. Ugh, I’m petrified even typing that. But I need to do it.

If any of this resonates with you, I invite you to do something to acknowledge your grief along with me. We can’t create space for wholeness without letting go of what has helped us, protected us, thus far. For me, I write out my grief. Others burn something symbolic. Maybe I’m enabling pyros here, but I’m going on record as saying I’m all for that ritual. Whatever your jam is, allow yourself to mourn this transition.

Goodnight, my friends. Tomorrow is a new day. Thanks for allowing me to make space for it.
