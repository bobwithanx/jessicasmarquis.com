He’s been discharged from the hospital. We’re still waiting for results, b̶u̶t̶ and I want y’all to know we’re home. Not “but”; but cancels out the significance of what came before it. “And” includes both as significant. It’s not either/or, but both/and. We are waiting \*and\* joyful. We are concerned _and_ celebrating. Living in the tension of equally valid experiences.

Yet another thing depression has taught me: It’s possible to feel sad while laughing wholeheartedly. I’d venture to guess you know that, too. But our brains (and culture) may not allow that coexistence; instead, we think if we feel one way we must appear that way. If people know we’re hurting, we mustn’t be seen with a smile - they may think us healed. But if we’re hurting in a socially unacceptable way - coping with mental illness, grieving the loss of a pet, trying to process a terminal disease or a miscarriage or a family member’s incarceration - we ought nonetheless to appear happy, and that happiness must leak into our inner state so we become happy.

And thus, we laugh with guilt, and we sit somberly while suppressing the urge to dance.

My family is dancing today. We’re sashaying into school with grins on our faces. I’m taking myself out for lunch and giggling with the server. When I think of our follow-up appointment with the doctor, I feel the weight of possible life change, \*and\* it can integrate into this moment of being alive.

Thank you for your prayers, encouragement, & positive thoughts. Love you, my friends.
