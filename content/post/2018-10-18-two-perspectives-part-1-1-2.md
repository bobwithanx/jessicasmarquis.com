3/4 of the way through writing part 2 of my [**earlier post**](https://www.jessicasmarquis.com/post/2018-10-18-two-perspectives-part-1/), it hit me that it required prerequisite knowledge of the culture. Those without could understand the post, yes, but it would make more sense with some framework. It’s like the difference between watching a 3D movie with and without the glasses. This post will serve as your glasses for [**part 2**](https://www.jessicasmarquis.com/post/2018-10-18-two-perspectives-part-2/) in the twoperspectives series.

Conservative white evangelical (CWE) culture differs from many Christian traditions in that it doesn’t tend to share common rituals or texts. No Stations of the Cross, no Revised Common Lectionary. Nonetheless, the churches do share [common beliefs](https://www.nae.net/what-is-an-evangelical/). They also have similar applications of those beliefs, as well as [values and moral codes](http://www.pewforum.org/2011/06/22/global-survey-beliefs/).

As I mentioned in part 1, a common value was men as authority. This could be latent, as in my original faith community where the verbal message was that women were equal to men, but in practice we could not serve or lead in certain roles. On the other hand, that value could be blatant, like in my friend’s fundamentalist community where she had to renew a card each year stating she would submit herself to men’s authority.

An outsider may assume that women in that community would take action to achieve true equality if given the right data, positive role models, convincing arguments, alternative experiences. What the outsider does not realize is that women - and all members of the community - are protected against such influences. Not only through external rerouting, such as the news sources I mentioned in part 1, but through internal safeguards. Their perception has been shaped to believe any other way of living is not “different,” as left-leaning Christians like to label it. They perceive different as “wrong.”

One of the prime ways this happens is by what I refer to as the Back-of-Math-Textbook approach. Remember those fantastic textbooks that gave a sampling of answers at the end? It turbo-charged our homework process - until the smart teachers started making us show our work. We had the answer but had to figure out how we would get to it. That’s how many religious beliefs were disseminated to me:

“Here’s what we believe. Now figure out why it’s right. Or just trust us that it is.”

I wasn’t one to simply believe everything I was told, so I put in the effort to show my work. I had to sacrifice logic, make leaps of faith, and sometimes excuse ethical transgressions to get to the answer, but, if I trusted that my authority figure spoke for God, then I believed God had given the stamp of approval to do all of that. This was how I justified a lot of stuff that embarrasses me now to admit.

Another reinforcement of the group perspective comes from making gut reactions spiritual. When something different (i.e., “wrong”) appeared on my radar, my gut, of course, instinctively reacted against it. I’d been taught it was wrong, and so my body and brain rejected it. The explanation I was given by my faith community? That was the Holy Spirit providing discernment. See, once we believe the Holy Spirit is warning us away from foreign concepts, we will avoid - if not flee - from them.

A third way - and a biggie - are the warnings. “Slippery slope,” “falling away,” “opening the door for sin,” “false teachings,” “listening to the world,” “corrupting influence,” “letting the devil get a foothold.” The list of warning cliches goes on. Fear of these controlled so many of my decisions. I often followed guidelines and didn’t break rules, not because I agreed with them, but because I dreaded the punishment. I didn’t stray far from the teachings or the core values because I didn’t want to lose God’s favor or jeopardize my status as a Christian. Thus, I lived in shame over the rules I did break (and had to hide), and I strived to keep our culture’s black-and-white morals from becoming gray. If I found exceptions to a rule on behalf of someone I cared about, it wasn’t called “giving grace,” but rather “moral relativity.” We didn’t live in tension or permit doubt; we followed the script so God didn’t think us unfaithful.

Those are merely three ways that I stayed immune to alternative perspectives that somehow made it through my news source filters. This is why it took me so long to get to objectivity: I thought I was already there. I couldn’t imagine listening to things I deemed “liberal,” which triggered “the Holy Spirit” within me. I didn’t comprehend that some “liberal” stuff was actually neutral - but it was left of me. Plus, I’d been told liberals were “godless” and trying to destroy the church, and I trusted my sources. I looked for evidence that supported that, and it took a gradual accumulation of counter-evidence the size of Mt. Kilimanjaro to convince me otherwise. Also, I discovered “liberals” don’t tend to use the word “liberal.”

Why am I taking the time to write this precursor post? Because it shows how ingrained the culture is, and why a lot of people from my original faith tradition won’t read what I’ve written. It isn’t a matter of getting the right article into people’s hands or making the matter personal to them. It’s much bigger and deeper. BUT it isn’t hopeless. The people who have contributed to this post series have been able to see beyond the parameters initially assigned them. People commenting on the initial post on Facebook and sharing it have as well. Worries plagued me, preventing me from searching beyond my church’s library for many years. Those years ended when I recognized that my God, one of grace and adventure, gave me agency and autonomy. I wanted to make sure my beliefs were based on research I had done and guidelines I believed in, not rules handed to me by others. I also wanted to get to know God as love, not as taskmaster, punisher, and he who is perpetually disappointed with me.

The hardest topics for a CWE Christian to reconsider position on are often those sitting as cornerstones to voting. In my time in that community, those topics were same-sex marriage and abortion, but especially abortion. If one candidate was Pro-Life and the other was not, the first always got our vote regardless of their position on other issues. This is why I resisted examining how I got to that answer - and if I in my God-given agency could agree with it.

And that, my friends, is where I bid you goodnight.
