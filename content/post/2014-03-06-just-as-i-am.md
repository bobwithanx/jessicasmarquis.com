It seems whenever I start an attempt to better myself, I run into the situation Lisa Simpson encounters in a famous _Simpsons_ episode about pursuing vegan living: There is always a level of commitment higher than my current one.

I want to eat healthier, then discover the all-natural chicken I picked up is not organic. And then the organic chicken I bought was not free-range. And then that free-range chicken in my fridge was not locally raised. Talk about discouraging!

What I&#8217;m discovering in my walk with God, though, is that He isn&#8217;t concerned with me getting to the top level ASAP. When it comes to me, He doesn&#8217;t take into account that someone out there does three hours of prayer each morning; He loves that I am genuinely seeking conversation with Him. He isn&#8217;t asking me for a weeklong fast while I&#8217;m breastfeeding my toddler. What is He looking for? That I not compare myself with others, but to keep walking in the way He is leading _me_ (Galatians 6:4-5).

So let&#8217;s banish the concerns about becoming &#8220;Level 5 vegans&#8221;. God loves us where we are at, and He will get us to the next level by His grace & in His time.
