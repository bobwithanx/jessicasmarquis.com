The hardest part was accepting the word “abuse”. What I’d endured was normal, I thought. It was to be expected of being around someone aggressive & temperamental. Why bother naming it? Why did others have to name it in their lives? It was in the past. It was just how things were.

Then I let myself name it. And I got mad. I raged for my younger self, the one who shrugged it off and let others minimize it. I raged for others who experienced anything like it and had not been told it was wrong, that they deserved to be safe, who had tried to forget it and didn’t want to talk about it.

But I had to first name it. Then I could be angry for myself because I have value. Then I could be angry for others because they have value.

_We_ need to name it. We need to be angry on behalf of victims. Anger is essential to progress. As humans, we must worry when anger about abuse is absent.
