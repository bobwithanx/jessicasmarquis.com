Take a deep breath. In through your nose...out through your mouth... Now another: In through your nose...out through your mouth... Keep going while I soothe you with the dulcet tones in this sans serif font of Friday Night Blogging. 

You have had a week. It didn’t go as planned, and your energy is in the red. You need a fill-up pronto, or you’ll sputter to a stop in the arid desert of this no-\[wo]man’s-land you’re passing through. Yes, you’re just passing through. I promise.

In through your nose...out through your mouth...

Maybe you took a risk and experienced a breakthrough. Maybe you took a risk and experienced something less positive. Maybe you made a mistake and are paying the consequences. Maybe someone else made a mistake and you’re paying the consequences. Maybe all four. 

But you’re here now.

And you’re here now.

In through your nose...out through your mouth...

You are important. You have value. You are capable. You are lovable. It feels like you’re all out of everything. Feel it, own it, and rest. Listen to your body. Honor your body. Tell your body it is important, has value, is capable, is lovable. Tell your body it is connected to humanity, all of which is important, has value, is capable, is lovable. You are a link in time and in geography, and you are resting tonight after a week of living.

In through your nose...out through your mouth...

Thank you for being you, for sharing your strengths and discoveries, for admitting your weakness and wrongness, for connecting as your raw and real self. I see you.

Goodnight, friends. Breathe on.
