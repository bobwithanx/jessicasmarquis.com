~I urge Euodia and Syntyche to iron out their differences and make up. God doesn’t want his children holding grudges. And, oh, yes, Syzygus, since you’re right there to help them work things out, do your best with them. These women worked for the Message hand in hand with Clement and me, and with the other veterans—worked as hard as any of us. Remember, their names are also in the Book of Life.  
~Philippians 4:2-3

Is God calling you to let go of a grudge & be reconciled to another brother or sister in Jesus? Or is He asking you to be a Syzygus & be the peacemaking mediator in others&#8217; lives? Listen to the Spirit today with humble openness, and trust Him for the courage to act &#8211; it will make the journey together with each other much easier & amazing!
