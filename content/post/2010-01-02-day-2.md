it&#8217;s not so much that i was craving tea.

often my cravings force me into a no-nonsense beeline, and, since this was more of a leisurely sunday drive on a friday afternoon, all signs point to no craving.

no, what i was after was more the process than the result. so i embarked on a mini-adventure up the 51, next to the mountains that pop up & appear to swallow cars at shea, heading toward the artsy pedestrian bridges south of greenway. my moonroof was open as the sun warmed my shoulders, and i don&#8217;t recall what i was listening to on the radio.

i was the only one in the parking lot at my favorite tea place, <a href="http://www.whiteaugusttea.com/">white august</a>, and the tattooed woman who helped me select a white dessert tea called &#8220;ciao bella&#8221; didn&#8217;t mind a customer to interrupt the non-busyness of the day. we chatted as my leaves steeped, and then i departed again, no real plan in mind.

and as i rounded the bend & saw a hazy downtown on the horizon framed by south mountain, i was grateful for this reset. passion came not in the accumulation but in the absorption.

one hour rejuvenated me for one week. now that&#8217;s an equation i can embrace.
