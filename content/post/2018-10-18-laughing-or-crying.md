I've lived with depression and anxiety as far back as I can remember. I'm also a stay-at-home parent, trying to succeed in the most demanding job I’ve ever held while various issues pop up and I wrestle them. It’s like a really lousy video game.

Yesterday, my middle child heard me giggling and asking, “Mama, are you laughing or crying?” It was a legit question. I know the unsettling feeling of seeing a parent cry, and my kids have seen it more than I’d prefer. So today I want to talk about parenting while dealing with a mental health condition.

Be forewarned: I’m not offering a bullet-point list of how to be awesome in spite of these conditions. I’m sharing what it’s like to work in an absurdly demanding job with a malfunctioning brain - and that it’s 100% okay (and necessary!) to be imperfect.

I’ll start with this bit of baggage I’ve lugged around. When I was in grad school, a student presented on a journal article about how children who had moms with bipolar disorder showed more secure attachment than children who had moms with depression. The class discussed these findings, concluding that the former group had experienced moments of affection during the mom’s manic states, whereas the latter most likely did not have that opportunity. Yes, the kids with depressed mothers had consistency, but they didn’t have warmth in it.

So of course I’ve thought often about that article while navigating these lava flows. (I’d say “waters”, but that sounds serene.) I ruminated on other research (especially [Harlow’s monkeys](https://youtu.be/_O60TYAIgC4)), probably to an unhealthy degree. I did my best to be a “cloth mother”, despite feeling agitated and hopeless within. As you can probably guess, these intense efforts added to my anxiety.

Each day, I tried to give myself kudos for keeping my kids alive, and I didn’t raise that bar; standards positioned too high could prove detrimental. This low bar helped me get through the boys' #PoopChronicles, our youngest child's health issues, and consecutive months of sleep deprivation.

I kept telling myself I just needed a break. I kept telling Bob that, too, so he found ways to give me time outs. They helped, but only for a short time. Like local anesthetic, I returned feeling great, but then the pain and exhaustion set back in. It wasn’t the kids’ fault; they were energetic and exploring their worlds. And it wasn’t my fault; I didn’t have the emotional buffer to absorb the impact of all that energy and exploration. Nonetheless, I had been appointed the adult via nature, so it was up to me to find a solution.

So I hid. A lot. I won’t deny it. I didn’t want to snap at anyone or pull them into my vortex of sorrow, so I made sure they were safe and then kept a distance to self-soothe. An inordinate amount of my energy went into finding ways to relax and recharge. Again, these acted as local anesthetic, and then I could perform well for short periods of time. And then I needed another break.

At this point in the story, I want to emphasize that I wasn’t neglectful toward my job or apathetic toward my kids. A parent with a mental health condition doesn’t automatically become irresponsible. That is a narrative we frequently hear, the one of the mom who drinks too much or the dad who avoids family interaction or the caregiver who leaves the baby in a public place and walks away. NO. Many of us tend to work harder than we should have to in order to compensate for our fair-to-poor mental health. The irony is that in doing so we make it worse.

Therapy helped. Prayer and meditation helped. Alone time and relationships helped. Vitamins and fresh air helped. A healthy diet and physical activity helped. Sleep, when I could get it, helped. A nightly glass of wine or pint of beer helped. But all those weren’t enough for me. I still carried heaviness somewhere southwest of my heart, and none of my natural remedies reduced it.

My brain started to play tricks on me, making me think this could be my new normal. Maybe this was what the rest of my life was meant to feel like. Then I remembered what musician Mike Doughty wrote in his memoir 'The Book of Drugs', of how when he was 29 he thought death was imminent. Then he saw Jennifer Lopez - also 29 - dancing on TV, and he realized what was possible and sought help beyond himself. I wanted to see what was possible for me, even if I'd passed the 29 mark. I mean, Jennifer Lopez is 49 now, and she's still got the moves.

I’ve now been on meds for four months, and everyone in the house has noticed a change in my demeanor. I have energy to get through the day. I laugh from my belly, not just my chest. I maintain my cool when all three kids are yelling in nightmarish stereo. I can think straight enough to plan a trip to the library _and_ carry it out. These may sound insignificant, but they are huge. Remember when I said I kept forgetting to make dinner? Yeah, this is progress. I’m celebrating each improvement and reminding myself of my growth, because it’s easy to get discouraged when only looking at the end goal. I may have moved the bar higher than “Keep the kids alive,” but “Make sure they eat fully organic meals that I prepare individually at each meal time while teaching them multiplication tables in Spanish” is still a long way off. I'm not even sure I want that.

I’ve been straightforward with all three of my kiddos, particularly because we share genetic material and they may one day contend with similar diagnoses. I tell them why I have to leave the room when I’m overwhelmed, and I explain that being sad isn’t a bad thing. We also have a family agreement to monitor and respect my energy levels since I’m still “getting better”. They know I’m taking medicine to help with that, and one day soon I may be able to take them to Castles ’n’ Coasters. (Probably not.)

And you know what? I think all this has made us more gracious with each other. If my kids know I have flaws that I’ve accepted, flaws I don’t hide or reject, they probably won’t hold themselves or others to unrealistic standards. Those are the kind of people our world needs. I guess that’s the consolation prize of being a parent with a malfunctioning brain.

If so, I’m good with that.
