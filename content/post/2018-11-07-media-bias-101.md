They say the best person to give you the definition of "psychology" is not a PhD psychologist but a first-semester Pysch-101 student. The student doesn't have enough info to get bogged down with nuances & complexities. So, with that reasoning, I'm about to talk about journalism. And I'm positive I will demonstrate my novice-hood here because I'm not a journalist. I pray you'll have grace with me and gently correct me if I need to make edits to what follows.

So when we read stories in the newspaper & online, they are written by humans. These humans have innate biases because they are, well, human. Like us. (Or me. I don't mean to make any assumptions about you, my cyborg pals.) In a newspaper, there are editorial writers and journalists; in blogs, the writers are usually editorial. The term "editorial" indicates the writer is sharing an opinion, perhaps based on facts but interpreting them to prove a point. Journalists are paid to be objective, to simply report the facts; if they turn editorial it compromises their integrity and, possibly, their jobs.

For example, I have a friend whose husband is a journalist. He cannot register with a political party or even indicate any affiliation. There must be no sign of impropriety, or he might be fired. Because he is a journalist. If he worked in the op-ed section, it would not be a problem. In fact, it would be expected.

Why does this matter? Because we need to recognize when we're sharing other people's opinions and when we are sharing facts. If all we are reading are blogs or op-eds, we are indeed getting information and interesting reasoning, but we aren't necessarily getting a chance to form our own opinions from the basic facts. We also are being influenced by others' perspectives, even if we don't realize it.

If you can't tell for sure if something is editorialized, look for sensational adjectives or leading statements. For example, these can be: 

\-derogatory: "ignorant", "racist", "bleeding-heart"

\-hyperbolic: "the worst", "worthless", "you won't believe this"

\-overly praiseworthy: "absolutely flawless", "the best", "you won't believe this!"

Okay, so now that we have an idea of what we're reading and what we're sharing, we need to also recognize that having a steady, heavy stream of inflammatory articles (or perhaps a more appropriate term here would be "essays") increases the chance that the only people who are reading what we share are people who already agree with us. Research has indicated that we tend to reject what doesn't agree with our worldview - [here is ](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds?fbclid=IwAR1fWa68L0fSRsDzYu-nea6dJ1ifhetTWg57dmcxNQLqSXDCjlOFmXSYG5M)a fascinating write-up on this. (For Jesus-followers, also check out Christena Cleveland's incredible social psychology-infused book [_Disunity in Christ: Uncovering the Hidden Forces that Keep Us Apart_](http://a.co/d/bkdnGM9).)

Thus, even though we are sharing what we consider to be powerful arguments that should sway all readers who interact with our flow of truth, these pieces are only sounding like noise to the other side. Especially if they have multiple exclamation points.

I'm not knocking blogs or op-eds or TV pundits. I'm simply saying we need to recognize their place. And we need to temper our own view so we can see more than just our side (even though our side is _always_ the right side).

Which brings me to the last piece of my amateur approach to journalistic analysis: How to weigh our sources. There has been a chart floating around in various iterations, and the current one looks like the one above. The placement of some of the news sources has been debated, and I also use [this site](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com) to research sources, but we need _somewhere_ to start from. Bottom line: If we only read HuffPo or The Blaze, we can bet we're not getting the whole story.

One of my friends said her mom signed up for materials from one political party, and her dad signed up for materials supporting the other. What a brilliant way to pursue knowledge & balance! We need not fear learning about the other side - it may even challenge us to explore new things we may not have otherwise.

So there you have it. I can't guarantee anyone from across the aisle is going to start reading what you share, but I can bet you that sharing more from the middle sources of this chart will help alleviate outrage fatigue so we can focus on the most pressing issues in our country _and_ world, and so we can be good countrymen/women to one another.

Love you guys. I'm taking off my novice hat now so I can put on my professional hat of Netflix-viewer. <3
