i like this concept a lot:

  &#8220;<a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/oempro4/track_link.php?p=Q2FtcGFpZ25JRD0xNTl8fHx8QXV0b1Jlc3BvbmRlcklEPXx8fHxTdWJzY3JpYmVySUQ9NDI4Mjd8fHx8TGlzdElEPTJ8fHx8TGlua1VSTD1hSFIwY0RvdkwzZDNkeTV5Wld4bGRtRnVkRzFoWjJGNmFXNWxMbU52YlM5c2FXWmxMM2RvYjJ4bExXeHBabVV2Wm1WaGRIVnlaWE12TVRrMk5EUXRZMjl1Ym1WamRHbHVaeTFpZVMxa2FYTmpiMjV1WldOMGFXNW58fHx8TGlua1RpdGxlPXx8fHxQcmV2aWV3PQ%3D%3D">connecting by disconnecting</a>&#8220;.</p>


      i&#8217;ve also been recently made aware of a multi-tasking fast:

      doing only one thing at a time.

      mono-tasking.


      while i don&#8217;t struggle with a crackberry addiction or a need to drown my thoughts with the radio,

      i do find myself wasting time being too &#8220;plugged in&#8221;.

      i&#8217;m not certain i could or should unplug completely in today&#8217;s culture,

      but this article has challenged me to cut back.


      i realized how much i needed to as i watched TV last night while

      <ul>
      <li>
        emailing
      </li>
      <li>
        working on a book proposal
      </li>
      <li>
        writing an article
      </li>
      <li>
        texting
      </li>
    </ul>

          <i>eliminating one of those things would increase the quality of all the others.</i>


          i think i&#8217;ll consider attempting the unplugging endeavor or the mono-tasking challenge.

          or at least a modified variation of one.
