Some of you know my personal commitment not to attend events or institutions that do not provide an LGBTQ-affirming viewpoint. It need not be the sole viewpoint, but it must be represented and given due respect. As a result, I’ve learned to decode the language described by [this article](https://medium.com/solus-jesus/the-new-hip-churches-are-fooling-google-they-pop-up-as-gay-friendly-its-a-hoax-6d8c4ae1764c). Unfortunately, not everyone has gained this experience, and members of the LGBTQ community continue to be wounded by what can equate to false advertising.

I have privilege as a straight person - I can attend religious events and be welcomed without suspicion or limits on my activities (except in situations that place limits on women, but I don’t go to those so that’s a moot point). These siblings do not have that freedom. So I use my privilege to make a point that my time, money, and attention will not be given to anyone that causes further trauma to queer individuals (& families).

This is my conviction & decision; others may attend such situations to be the change. My personal goal is to create & support safe places for my siblings because these churches often do not. Instead, they often produce ex-Christians.
