Grief sucks. Cryptogenic grief sucks even more. Looking up the word ‚Äúcryptogenic‚Äù is oddly satisfying. 

If you didn‚Äôt look it up, what I‚Äôm saying is that grief can appear without an apparent source, and it's a special kind of awful. I slogged through it a while back, and it wasn‚Äôt until I had gotten through Denial, Anger, Bargaining, and was mostly through Depression that I realized what was going on. It launched me back into Anger for a fresh round.

The grief resulted from interrogating my beliefs and discovering how many didn‚Äôt hold up. It was like taking apart a complicated contraption and setting off the stink bomb hidden inside. Grief is a stink bomb. You can quote me on that.

I was reminded of this process while researching the previous #TwoPerspectives [post]((https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156755412187387&set=a.10150363403412387&type=3&permPage=1)), the one on transgender identity. Part of my writing involves reviewing primary sources on both sides of the discussion and compiling key arguments. My heart sped up as I clicked on URLs of formerly trusted sites, ones that I now recognized to rely on stereotypes, hyperbole, fear, and other manipulations to convey their message and impress it upon the conscience. (They also impressed it upon my unconscious, an unpleasant surprise to me as I lived my life and suddenly found myself at moments of unshakable, unfounded shame.)

I‚Äôll cut through all the blah blah blahs and get to my point. I thought that people - particularly leaders - who claimed to follow Jesus periodically reevaluated their beliefs to ascertain if their interpretation of scripture contained flaws. If it did, I figured they would set the interpretation aside and find ways to adjust or replace it so it would be more aligned with Jesus‚Äô heart for all people to experience wholeness and God‚Äôs love. I‚Äôm not sure where I got this; probably from my files labeled ‚ÄúCommon Sense‚Äù. I assumed the goal was to be generous, to look for ways to include more people, promote more people, share the platform with new voices, create space for new ideas. Co-creation with the Creator.

In my time of taking apart that stink-bomb-holding contraption of beliefs - a process that the kids these days are calling ‚Äúdeconstruction‚Äù - I examined the evidence supporting my assumption. 
Only there wasn‚Äôt any. 
There were things gussied up* as evidence, but when I pulled out my magnifying glass I saw they were the same old practices and exclusions with new names.

I‚Äôm getting too abstract here, so let me give you something concrete. The white church served as a significant [_obstacle_](<https://www.christianitytoday.com/history/issues/issue-33/why-christians-supported-slavery.html and http://time.com/5171819/christianity-slavery-book-excerpt/>) to abolishing slavery. Later, when they had the chance to do right that wrong and support the black community, many white Christians instead [_opposed_](http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-322) civil rights. 

The conservative white evangelical (CWE) church has been true to its first adjective, boasting a track record of preservation, precedents, and an endless library of apologetics to justify and maintain their positions. While within it, I failed to grasp that upholding these often came at the cost of real progress toward equality, inclusion, and revolution. 

Getting more specific to the conversation in Part 3, the key to many of today‚Äôs hottest issues in the CWE church lies in gender separation. Not only does this affect trans rights, but it also affects the conversations on same-sex marriage and the role of women. If gender isn‚Äôt binary and if all are made in God‚Äôs image without concern about gender, then people can love whomever they love, and anyone with the appropriate gifting and equipping can lead. 

Isn‚Äôt that exciting news‚ÄΩ Well, it would be if one‚Äôs goal is to celebrate with as many as possible, to love without exclusion or priority. However, my unconscious self, full of those old impressions, objects: ‚ÄúThat isn‚Äôt the goal. They need to be made right and know what‚Äôs right in order to celebrate with us. Then it‚Äôs a real celebration!‚Äù

That objection tips me off to a much bigger story: Every time something new was introduced as a possibility, our authority figures jumped up to disprove or delegitimize it. They called it ‚Äúdefending the flock‚Äù, but as a member of that flock I would have liked to have done the research for myself. R-rated movies received scathing reviews to prevent us from seeing them. Evolution was written off before I even got to know the basic principles. Women who wanted to be pastors were cast into the category of ego-driven bitches (but without that title, because swearing was off-limits). 

I became well-versed at defending and reacting. I knew what we were against and who we were not. Unfortunately, the muscles and brain parts used for proactive behavior - creating, advocating, defining who we _were_ - were used much less frequently. I‚Äôd even say some atrophied. 

We retracted more often than we expanded. 

When we did expand, there was always pushback. Desegregation, for example - whites worshiping with People of Color - was not received with enthusiasm. It still isn‚Äôt, 50 years after Martin Luther King, Jr.‚Äôs, death. So to think that new information or a reassessment of scripture will be embraced is to set ourselves up for acute disappointment for being obtuse. 

Removing something that exists as a key joint in decision-making on who‚Äôs in, who‚Äôs out, and who goes where will cause the contraption to collapse. This is why deconstruction follows awakening. And this is why grief accompanies deconstruction. 

If you‚Äôre starting to make room for questions, or if you‚Äôre entering a state of disintegration\*\*, you aren‚Äôt alone. Many have tread this path before you and are doing it alongside you; you just don't see them because the path is dark. Keep in mind that many have shrunk back in fear - if you're_ anywhere_ on the path, I applaud your courage!

Make room for the grief. Set margins to be angry or confused or depressed. Have grace with yourself when you emote without warning - it's all part of deconstructing so you can reconstruct. It may be If you know what I‚Äôm talking about, clap your hands. 

This entry won‚Äôt have a long list of recommended resources, studies, or statistics. I‚Äôm simply spilling my heart and sharing why and how I faded from one community. My reconstruction led me to another community where my heart beats more in synch with the Divine. I love it here. I have peace here and don‚Äôt need to remind myself to cease striving, because anxiety and fear no longer catalyzes my actions. Love pulls action from me, energizing me and connecting me to others. This is home.

I‚Äôll be back with another #TwoPerspectives post soon. PM me if there are any you‚Äôd like to learn about, especially before the election next week. Informed and compassionate voters are the best kind! ‚Ä®

Take a moment to dance today, my friends.

\*- Total tangent: My mom says grade school teachers expressed concern about my 1940s vocab, courtesy of my live-in grandma. The fact that ‚Äúgussied up‚Äù was the first phrase that came to mind here indicates they were onto something.

\*\* - The paintings below are both by Salvador Dali: The Persistence of Memory (1931) and The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory (1952-1954). Perhaps there is one you connect with more.
