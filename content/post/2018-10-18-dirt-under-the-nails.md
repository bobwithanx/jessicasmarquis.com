A while back, an acquaintance asked how I could be depressed if I believed in God. He was under the impression that someone classified as "Christian" couldn't ever experience meaninglessness, anxiety, or deep sadness. So I cracked my knuckles and I told him I was still human, and my spirituality didn't take away from that experience. Nonetheless, his comment stuck with me - probably because I've heard it elsewhere. So I'm about to impale that lie. Get ready for some carnage.

I've posted about how mental health issues aren't signs of weakness or personal failings. Often, they have a chemical/somatic root. I won't waste space rehashing that info, but if you want to know more check out the [Crash Course in Psychology](https://youtu.be/ZwMlHkWKDwM) YouTube channel.

Even knowing all that, though, stigma abounds. We feel less than when we're emotionally fragile or unbalanced. We think we're supposed to be happy and have the joy joy joy joy down in our hearts. Where? Down in our hearts! So we hide or minimize or fake it till we make it. And we fool ourselves into thinking we're making it. And then we burn out.

I met with a psychiatrist earlier this week. I figured I should see a specialist if I was taking more than one medication for an issue, so I surfed the web and picked a name who accepted my insurance. She proved to be a spectacular listener, and also informed me I don't have dementia (yet). Score one for me! She asked when I had my first suicidal ideation, and I told her at age 11. She glanced up from her notes with eyes wider than she may have intended. I told her about my depression history, and how we hid it and how it metastasized. And now I'm nearly 40 sitting in her office asking for help that I started asking for at age 11 - help I needed at age 11. Stigma abounds, and stigma stifles.

What especially pisses me off is how people who don't have the wiring for mental health disorders speak down to those who do. They dispense advice: have more faith, pray more, spend more time with family. Here's the truth: If you haven't wrestled with something, don't give advice to people who do. And, my friends, please don't ask those who have succeeded on natural ability how to improve your lack of it. They haven't had to. Instead, look to those who have suffered and overcome and fallen down and then climbed back up by their fingertips with dirt under their nails.

If we stop listening to the people who preach that lack of happiness and peace indicates lack of wholeness and maturity, we can make space for real talk. We can make space for lament, which is critical to our souls' health. What if instead of resisting and ignoring our struggles, we integrated them into our day-to-day existence? What if we told our friends, "I'm late to dinner because I had a panic attack," or informed our kids, "I'm not as energetic these days because I'm feeling sad"?

The fact is, they may say, "I get that," "I've been there," "Thanks for trusting me." Or maybe they won't. Maybe they'll give you the side-eye or stop inviting you to dinner. But you're living for health and well-being, for authentic spirituality and interaction with the Divine that includes all parts of yourself.

So, in closing, if you're in relationship with anyone or anything that won't allow you to bring your whole self, then it's time for a relationship makeover. And you can start by hanging out with people who have dirt under their nails.
