Aaaaaaaaaand now, back to our program! If you’re just joining us, this is part 2 of a post series called #TwoPerspectives, insights I’ve gained from my life in both the conservative and the left-leaning Christian traditions. You can read [**part 1**](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156688766032387). I won’t recap - I’d rather just dive right into the boiling water of Roe v. Wade. (TW: abortion)

If you just felt your stomach contract and a flash of anxiety ambush your body, you aren’t alone. Some of you may even wonder if you’re allowed to read this. If that resonates loudly (or sounds odd), please read my [**intro post**](https://www.facebook.com/jessica.s.marquis/posts/10156703623422387.) that describes aspects of the Conservative White Evangelical culture.

All disclaimers from part 1 still apply. And now I strap on my oxygen tank and dive. It's going to be a long, hot swim.

My high school debate teacher taught me whoever defines the terms wins the argument. This leads us to our first stop: the titles each side gives themself and the other. Pro-Choice calls the other side anti-abortion and anti-choice, and Pro-Life refers back to them as pro-abortion and anti-life. The ridiculous fact is that people who are Pro-Choice also like life and advocate for it in other arenas (including euthanasia and capital punishment, other “pro-life” issues), just as those who are Pro-Life also enjoy choice and advocate for it elsewhere. Therefore, these words are not mutually exclusive, and to start with them permits a false dichotomy. We fail from the outset.

Thus, I’m creating my own terms that reflect the core of each position, as I’ve experienced it. Pro-Choice in this post will be Woman’s* Choice Advocate (WCA), and Pro-Life will be Birth Only Advocate (BOA).

Now, many of us have been taught the “right” way to think about abortion. We carry it with pride and want to educate others to it. That is why I’m sharing this picture of my dresser. If you look _really _closely, you’ll see there are piles of stuff on it. And in front of it. And next to it. I’ll be honest - they’ve inhabited those spaces for over a year. Know why? Because if I attend to one thing, I have to attend to another, and then another. Once I get started, I don’t know how long it will take or what I’ll discover, and I’m not ready to make that kind of commitment. I have severe dust allergies, and spiders creep me out - I’m petrified of what could result.

I’m leaving something untouched that needs to be investigated. I’m doing this out of stubbornness and fear: I don’t want to take the time, I don’t want to discover what lies beneath, nor do I want to make space for what will result when I dismantle it all. It's easier to leave it undisturbed.

That was also a description of my position on abortion for the first few decades of my life. Today, I invite you to join me in dissecting the piles. Dust masks and gardening gloves on, my friends.

Growing up conservative, I learned early that abortion = killing babies. Thus, my family was staunchly BOAs, along with everyone around us. My brother was saved from an abortion by his bio mom, we adopted him as an infant, my parents helped start a crisis pregnancy center, and I volunteered and marched on behalf of pregnancy and adoption. Our church observed a day each year where we remembered and grieved all the babies who didn’t get to live because of abortions. We read pamphlets that had horrific pictures of babies who had been aborted. We celebrated eleventh-hour changes of heart, where the woman made the decision to keep her baby.

With all this around me and nothing else to challenge it, I had no reason to question whether preserving life was of utmost priority. Anyone who had an abortion must not have cared about their baby, I figured. I assumed the doctors who performed the abortions were sadistic monsters preying on vulnerable women who might have been swayed if the right person had revealed to them the truth about abortion. Sadly, that ex-mother would eventually come around and be very sad she killed her baby. After all, we heard the stories of how most women regretted having an abortion, or else they buried down their pain and it came out in self-destructive habits and beliefs.

With a steady stream of these hyperboles, caricatures, celebrations, and fears, I could never understand how anyone could be anti-life. “Pro-choice” didn’t give the _baby_ a choice, only the mother, and that was deemed selfish. Babies needed to be born, and there would always be a couple ready to adopt the child if the mother didn’t want it or couldn't handle it. With all this, there was no need for abortion, so it needed to be made illegal.

Then my friend told me she was pregnant by a violent partner who had a history of stalking behavior. If she had the baby, she and the child would never be safe. She decided to terminate her pregnancy and escape her partner. Shortly after, my friend with severe health issues told me she had gotten pregnant and shouldn’t have been able to, and her condition could end both her and the baby’s life. She terminated the pregnancy. Then my Christian friend told me she had gotten an abortion as a teenager, before she was a Christian, and she had no regrets about it.

Of course, I had easy answers to all of those:

Friend 1: Adopt out the baby. 

Friend 2: Stay pregnant and see how it goes because God works miracles. 

Friend 3: Adopt out the baby or build a support system to help raise it.

But the truth was much more complex - as, I’ve discovered, it always is.

Friend 1 was deeply attached to her child. She wanted a baby and thought she was past the point of being able to conceive. I sat with her at the pregnancy center when the nurse confirmed the pregnancy and gave her a little outfit to keep for her future kiddo. She beamed. She wasn’t a callous woman who valued her convenience over another’s - she was a woman who recognized that both this child and she may never experience peace. This was her solution for both.

Friend 2 was elated at the pregnancy, asking friends for maternity hand-me-downs and giddily describing how she imagined her kiddo would look. But she, too, realized that her situation may lead to a problematic life for one or both of them - if there was a life.

Friend 3 wasn’t mature enough to adopt out the baby nor raise it appropriately. She had no money, an unstable home life, and unreliable access to pregnancy support for the next nine months. She made the decision for the baby, with whom she felt no attachment because it was already a problem.

My textbook woman seeking an abortion and her textbook motive were rendered inaccurate. Two of these three friends wanted their babies, and the decision for abortion was accompanied by grief. Three of three believed they were doing more of a disservice by carrying and birthing that life than by terminating it.

With this data that didn't fit my formulas, I didn't know where I fell in the debate between BOA and WCA. This is where I went to the basics of the two sides.

WHAT ARE CORE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOA AND WCA?

BOAs use the word “baby” to describe what has been conceived. As a result, they view the termination/removal as sins of murder and of the adult woman abdicating her duty to nurture the life she created through her own actions. Some BOAs create a caveat for victims of rape or incest, or women who have miscarried and want a D&C; others do not. This is rooted in the belief that God creates life and allows death, and we worship through receiving both as they are, no intervention. They support adoption and view it as an alternative to abortion.

WCAs may use the term “fetus” for what has been conceived, although not all do. They may never have an abortion, and they may personally carry a pro-life ethic. They may appear like a BOA, but the difference is that they want \*others\* to have the choice. As Friend 3 told me, she wouldn’t get an abortion now, but she doesn’t want to decide for another woman. They also support adoption, but they believe a woman should choose if she wants to go through the pregnancy and give up her baby.

WHY DO WOMEN GET ABORTIONS?

While looking into reasons women seek abortions, I discovered that “inconvenience” (what my CWE community referred to as a woman’s selfishness) accounted for a minority of the [reasons represented](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5957082/).

With many of these reasons never going away - _especially_ poverty - I had to admit that if abortions were outlawed people would still find ways to have them, and those ways would be what the World Health Organization [classified as “unsafe”](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61786-8/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR0NPHZMdzskyxzM9nGdJaiu4tDBM0kn4JNfwgW0GUTn-Z2Nr8XWjebb3yY#secd94767934e1491). How do I know this? Because women were having abortions [before they were made legal](https://www.history.com/news/the-criminalization-of-abortion-began-as-a-business-tactic?fbclid=IwAR3qy1LGYpUu56wADr5MFvIUiUELoI3xr7BLCC4HGHv-Ejh9QYGT0TGEwU8) with Roe v. Wade.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS PERSONAL (AND FULL OF RESEARCH)

My friend was part of a CWE community while she was in high school. She had sex with her boyfriend and got pregnant. Her community was shocked, and she felt ashamed. Nonetheless, they provided support to her throughout her pregnancy, and she kept the baby. Her boyfriend proposed, but their church had a policy that anyone who had premarital sex could not marry there, nor with any of the pastors on staff. Thus, the couple quickly found another venue and officiant, and they got married. A while later, my friend found out her husband was an addict, and they divorced.

See, a woman in a BOA community that emphasizes women’s purity and opposes premarital sex will encounter that opposition when she confesses, by mouth or belly, “I did it.” Pregnancy outside of wedlock, then, is perceived as shameful, an obstacle to achieving virtuous standing in the faith community. The woman faces a decision: Terminate the pregnancy and defy her beliefs, or keep the baby and face the shame? My friend knew she would be subject to raised eyebrows and others’ judgments. She knew she couldn’t marry in her own church with her own pastor. She encountered consequences from the start.

My friend had the courage and support to face them. Other women do not, according to the data: In a [2015 survey](https://www.christianpost.com/news/70-of-women-who-get-abortions-identify-as-christians-survey-finds-150937/?fbclid=IwAR1_uxAC0tyaNH92m4le-s687c8prgaHClSVo1Tso90iQsPl0gk5YzLB_-E) by a Christian organization, 52% of Christian women who had abortions reported no one at their church knew. Independent of that survey, a [2014 study](https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/characteristics-us-abortion-patients-2014.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2pRh0wU3K9nSr8mLxpzPwuRw8LDhHvp4SjsqkJ6DkL2BZIEBbUlqLRqzU) of abortion patients found that 13% identified as evangelical, and 38% had “no religious affiliation” (the option I personally would select if I was an evangelical ashamed of getting an abortion).

Know what that means? There are women sitting next to us at church who had abortions and may never have told anyone. That includes women leaders, (here are [one example](https://www.thedailybeast.com/im-a-minister-and-a-motherand-i-had-an-abortion?ref=scroll&fbclid=IwAR1IxtqxDO5e5Cq6bmCXhGM_HUp-fmCR0Kq9jUV1UCCmJ7EyDYoXjkNtpXE) and [another](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/26/abortion-late-term-donald-trump-column/92691850/?fbclid=IwAR2BFtBhcdHLJchqWvT6HjhU2Wnzbk4DFwMcPa_OWLTjgfP0Dv_fbeqXpsY)), as well as male leaders who pressured women in their lives (here are [one example](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/november/11.28.html?fbclid=IwAR3mEhKWO7W9a4y0_Y5tezsIfV1-ZcwE_RNW6fZufFupZ7DApMM3Vu_V0-s) and [another](http://thebells.umhb.edu/2012/03/06/arterburns-struggle-with-abortion/?fbclid=IwAR3Ea76hkgYyxAmyTOGQWMtFetmdKhrwFilM88m6y0X-LMkeKi_BS0yGpBA)). 

The BOA culture in which I was raised created an environment in which failure (by their standards) was so frightening that we strived to pretend we hadn’t failed at all. As much as people talked about grace and “love the sinner hate the sin,” hating the sin leaked over to their treatment of the sinner. And so the unmarried hid their activities. According to most reported estimates, 80% of unmarried evangelicals have [had premarital sex](https://www.christianpost.com/news/are-most-single-christians-in-america-having-sex-56680/?fbclid=IwAR2-WDHgOI_lbEEvCsfyAP39snSAr6Ivv1T69kJGHPnnBZg0nUViTZRqJgs). Interestingly, the National Association of Evangelicals [has their own research](https://www.nae.net/most-unmarried-evangelical-millennials-have-never-had-sex/?fbclid=IwAR37HC2Hp6x489JInv9m6983f8OcmfYQNv5KFdODLpM9Mzm_1AZ0h92BNDY), reporting that only 46% have had premarital sex. Even if the latter number is correct, that is still close to half of the demographic.

Considering the numbers above, those taught abstinence-only sex ed were ill-prepared for when they had sex. Indeed, [one study](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-sex/201304/liberals-and-conservatives-are-both-wrong-about-teen-sex?fbclid=IwAR07Ck8w1oAOCsMTpRaI_lJ5995mhhY0AhTuW0UiKuJmkOZRQ0-A6BMsIYE) found that abstinence-only sex ed not only did not delay sexual activity, but that pregnancies actually increased. Again, if their community condemns abortion, these pregnancies may never be known.

So is the answer to make abortion illegal so no one can lawfully end their pregnancies? If making premarital sex off-limits hasn’t worked, then we need to consider prohibiting abortions won’t have the intended results. Which leads us to…

ROE v. WADE

Overturning Roe v. Wade was the brass ring in my conservative community. At times, it was treated as a panacea, as well as an omen that the U.S. was “turning back to Christ.” Unfortunately, when I started to dig outside of the Christian news sources I discussed in part 1, I discovered that such an overturn wouldn’t solve all that much. Indeed, [a study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(11)61786-8/fulltext?fbclid=IwAR1DMpiPHiIfbhS_vsCjNSf6CN_8Ne9S_3aYdA3nP5X46zhdlgNoc465DDI#secd94767934e1491) published in 2012 found that, worldwide, higher restrictions on abortions did not result in lower abortion rates. Although Roe v. Wade was to us symbolic of casual sex and the moral decline of the country, it had actually saved lives and created a way for those in poverty and/or addiction to not perpetuate the cycle by a new life that could not be supported. For example, [in 2014](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states?fbclid=IwAR1umh_tghdhNTn-QeSbXnJv2OwxXxpUFMrJCUFL4m7lUb19FpCcl_r3UuU), 75% of abortion patients qualified as low-income or poor. Also, [a study](https://academic.oup.com/alcalc/article/47/6/640/204854?fbclid=IwAR1MIbXG_YAemtt0Gxyw5otzc8A66iN_rqNT61n-3j6PuQQf0M0o6788t_M) published in 2012 found that 5% of abortions were because of alcohol, drug, or tobacco use.

And yet a voice from my Ghost of Reasoning Past declares, “The church should step in. The church is there to help these people.” But it isn’t. Sadly, saving a baby from abortion does not mean that child will be okay. Single moms who make this decision don’t suddenly receive a subsidy check for childcare or better access to Medicaid for child-rearing. Kids born to parents who cannot care for them do not get on the luxury track of the foster care system. None of this is new; [a 1986 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3100324?fbclid=IwAR2AknWxl2nxV4guPrIiudA3r5cQGBechpdnlgOsFGb-EH77NJGi3DmvG1E) found that “For every tax dollar spent to pay for abortions for poor women, about four dollars is saved in public medical and welfare expenditures.”\*\*

SO WHAT DO WE DO?

How do we deal with all this? Should we completely overturn Roe v. Wade?

The question we actually need to ask is, “Why?”

1. Are we doing it because we don’t want abortions to happen? Then we need to provide better sex education and access to birth control for people who are having sex and don’t know what they’re doing.

2. Are we doing it to save babies’ lives? Then we need to improve the systems into which they’ll be born, ensuring better quality of life and access to the services they need. Prior to life, we need to create a culture where pregnancy outside of marriage is not shamed nor the woman devalued. We must make a place where she feels welcomed and loved without condition or judgment, where she has unfettered access to resources (prenatal vitamins, checkups, baby items). If a life is saved because it is sacred, that value must be maintained from beginning to end.

3. Are we doing it because our abortion belief pile is too large and scary to take it apart? Then we need to take responsibility for our beliefs and do it anyway. We can’t accept simple solutions to complex issues, because, as we’ve seen above, those solutions aren’t effective.

I think that’s enough for now. If you need more resources, please let me know. I didn’t want to overwhelm you. 😉 For now, I’m exhausted and ready to power down. Thank you for taking the time and making the effort to understand a perspective beyond your own.

I love you all.

\* - “Woman” does not accurately encompass all genders that can become pregnant. However, since I could only think of “carrier” as the other option, and that connotes someone with a disease, we’ll have to allow this placeholder until a linguist greater than I provides the best word.

\*\* - Don’t let the “tax dollar” verbiage trip you up; there are very tight restrictions on any federal money being used. Here is a bunch of reading if you’re skittish about this - or just a geek for research. 

1. Federal tax dollars cannot be used to pay for abortions due to the [Hyde Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Amendment).

2. The funding that goes to Planned Parenthood is not directly used for abortions.

2a. There is [discussion](https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/how-federal-funding-works-at-planned-parenthood?fbclid=IwAR274GZYzpjoeC6T6zZNNAlnDH8HB5FANZNjxsr_T0iYZp0G4agxBr2SYs8) over how much is indirectly used. (Note: Both Forbes and American Enterprise Institute, the author’s research sponsor are conservative sources)

3. Although there are many clinics that provide abortion services, Planned Parenthood receives the most national attention. Planned Parenthood [reports](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/fact-check/2017/07/14/fact-check-planned-parenthood-abortion-services/448575001/?fbclid=IwAR3SjG1TFpckYuuhp-xP-KEI8pzIcEtdH9qWn913qqzIfSAPtsH6UIXaGfM) that abortion only accounts for 3% if its services, and 13.7% of its clients received an abortion. The 94% previously reported by a Republican senator was incorrect and misleading, and you can see [where](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/08/12/for-planned-parenthood-abortion-stats-3-percent-and-94-percent-are-both-misleading/?fbclid=IwAR3keWCUBTetjr3uqIZ6rju92f0-_LSXUykTJ6hOqrWeimWCQ_Nin37AiDU&noredirect=on&utm_term=.f2e8952ed3d3) he got it from.
