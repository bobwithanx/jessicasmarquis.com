If you haven’t noped out of social media this week, you‘re likely experiencing some degree of boiling in your blood. The news and the public’s response to it has been unsettling and, for many, triggering.

If anyone reading this is at all curious about the view from the other side, I’m going to use this space to share from each perspective. Having spent time in both the conservative Christian camp and the left-leaning Christian camp (and their respective political affiliations), I have been exposed to vile, miseducated statements in each one about the other side. I’m going to do my best to share insights on each for those who have not been in both.*

As is my routine, I’m providing disclaimers. My background is in conservative White Evangelical Christianity, but not fundamentalism. As a result, I have asked others with backgrounds from a spectrum of conservative Christianity (including fundamentalism) to edit and contribute to this post. I am no longer part of my original faith tradition, but if you’re looking for a cynical smackdown of evangelicalism look elsewhere. Also, please consider this your trigger warning (TW) that I’ll be talking about sexual assault and spiritual abuse. Lastly, I have done my best to include sources, but if you’d like ones I have not listed please let me know.

I’ll cut to the quick and talk first about:

SEXUAL HARASSMENT/ASSAULT

When the Anita Hill hearings took place in 1991, I never heard anything about her being a victim. In my conservative circle, she was painted as a conniver trying to ruin a good man’s reputation. No conversations about what sexual harassment can look like or exploration of Clarence Thomas’ potential guilt - it was a foregone conclusion “that woman” just wanted publicity and to smear this man.

I was not provided with statistics that backed up all the claims about why we must default to believing the man is innocent and the woman is the troublemaker. It was simply the narrative, typically accompanied with the statement, “Innocent until proven guilty.”

However, the statistics I did eventually find actually proved the opposite: Women [rarely issue false reports](https://qz.com/980766/the-truth-about-false-rape-accusations/?fbclid=IwAR0OMkyqPZJGMOnbMRS042uq2RPuuGn6i0P5g95s-qu_SSv7YmTTY-L3gtY).

If the guy was guilty in such an overwhelming majority of cases, why did a false belief persist that the woman is often lying? It was because my religion had a message woven throughout saying men’s words outweighed women’s. It wasn’t stated blatantly; instead, it was shown and reinforced through women not being in leadership roles that could provide insight and influence on important decisions, repetition of Bible stories where a woman was the seductress/screwup/weakling, and looking to men to lend credibility to women’s statements. Take, for instance, the extremely popular Women of Faith event - it was cofounded by a man. In fact, if you google “Women of Faith founder’, he is the one who shows up.

Men were placed in the role of decision-makers, leaders, credible sources, and having the final say. Thus, if a woman said something that contradicted a man’s report - especially if that man wore the label “Christian” - the default was to believe him, not her.

One contributor to this post described requesting marriage counseling from her pastoral team, with particular attention on her husband’s anger issues. They ignored the request, instead reprimanding her for usurping his authority. He was never talked to about her request.

What I say next is controversial, so I’ll end the paragraph with links to reported instances, which contain their own links to supporting evidence. The subtle promotion of male over female described above has led to a lot of confusion when a church leader has sex with a congregant (consensual or not). If he is important enough, his ministry is effective enough, the woman often stays quiet. She doesn’t want to hurt his good work or reputation. She knows she will become a pariah to those who respect him. She will have to find a new community, and either witness the downfall of his ministry or the shredding of her reputation - or both. Essentially, she does not report because of a power differential and the belief that he is more important than she.

That was my POV from inside my conservative upbringing. Inside the left-leaning camp, there is much more emphasis on believing the victim, not the accused. The focus is on collective human rights, especially those for women and minorities, who historically have not[ experienced rights equal](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2016/us-elections-2016-who-can-vote/index.html?fbclid=IwAR1BxnMhxVcJWC2my8J69xaVKnByzfa1oAonC5PxuEVxO2KM9F-rx9q6iQQ) with white men.

So why are we pushing this particular issue right now? The conservative side believes it is all about politics, and perhaps that is partially true. However, there has also been a longstanding problem in our country of not believing women, as well as treating them as second-class citizens. Some women believe this is the order of life, but those who do not are fighting back because they are finally seeing others are angry along with them.

The big question, of course, is: If it happened, why didn’t she report? Tough to answer if you haven’t experienced it or anything like it, so I’ll tell a story. When I helped a rape victim at a party, she was drunk and couldn’t tell me exactly what had happened. When we got to the hospital (which I strongly advised and she agreed to), the police questioned her if it was rape. She couldn’t remember if she’d said yes, and so they didn’t want to move forward with a report. What they didn’t tell her was if she was too drunk to remember, she was too drunk to give consent. And so this assault likely went unreported, even though she did talk to the police.

Others don’t have a mama bear escorting them to the hospital or to talk to the police. So they take a shower and weep on its floor. They are embarrassed. They are in shock. They are disoriented. In that state, they often blame themselves. They don’t report. This may go on for years. I have friends who are middle-aged and only now admitting what had happened and realizing it wasn’t their fault.

Some do make it to the police station. They may get someone who will listen to them. If you’ve watched _Law & Order SVU_, you may think police always go to bat for the victims. Some do, but many don’t. One friend who tried to meet with a detective received so many cancelations of the appointment that she finally gave up. Another friend who advocates for survivors of sexual assault recently received a letter from the county: They would not be pursuing prosecution of an alleged perpetrator, against whom they had a sizable amount of evidence.

A survivor of sexual assault put it this way: “The woman doesn’t tell because she can’t live through the grief twice. The first time she suffers the abuse; the second time she suffers the retelling of the abuse and the pain of being told it isn’t really as bad as she thinks. Or that it never happened. Or that it couldn’t have happened like she remembers. Or asked, ‘Are you sure?’”

When you aren't given power to identify and be believed about your assault, you can't fully heal from it. Many women have had this power stripped from them in subtle ways like those mentioned above, and the ones who are experiencing support in this moment are taking it back.

NEWS SOURCES

I want to start this section with the graph in the center of [this webpage](https://libguides.com.edu/c.php?g=649909&p=4556556). (Note: “libguides” is a library resource site, not a site for liberals.)

When I got to college and started writing research papers, I discovered I had a bias against many news sources in the center column in the featured graph. While they were viewed by my professors as the standards for objective journalism, I only knew them as “the liberal media”. I had learned through my authority figures not to trust the news from nonChristian sources because their goal was to challenge our morals and break them down.

Thus, we had our own news sources that we knew we could trust because they aligned with our faith values and what was referred to as a “biblical worldview”. This was handy because the world was huge; it was easy to get lost in it without a filter, a filter these sources provided.

We may have heard a story elsewhere, but we tested it against what we received from our Christian source. We didn’t question where the Christian version originated; if we thought about it at all, we figured it was generated by faithful people who had done proper research and were seeking God for guidance.

The bottom line was that, in many of our communities, there was little trust placed in secular academicians or publications that printed left-of-center pieces. Why read something that seemed to have an agenda to destroy everything I stood for? But this meant I rarely if ever heard another side of the story. This hampered my ability to make fully informed opinions and ideologies, so I began relying on additional sources so I could round out my understanding. I go into more detail on this concept [here](https://www.facebook.com/jessica.s.marquis/posts/10155033026867387).

Christians with left-leaning values do not tend to have a primary news source or organization at the intersection of journalism and faith. We use a variety or resources, including (and I'd venture to say especially) ones without ties to faith. Some may turn to a specific group to create their filter for news, but many are members of several groups. As a result of input from many sources, we may disagree among ourselves and change our minds upon new discoveries. This is why we grow frustrated in conversations when others refuse to examine carefully researched articles, peer-reviewed journals, or objective data that challenge their position.

The fact is that there is too much information to examine and weigh it all. We all need a filter; we all have bias. The key is to _know_ that we are using a filter and carrying bias. Thinking we have all the truth from a flawless news source or looking to someone else to form our opinions are each reckless decisions. We need to use the brain God gave us, not fear or avoid it.

You know what? I’m going to save this for another post.

In the meantime, I pray that this post may, in some small way, generate more compassion and less ugliness.

Yes, my evangelical friends, I still pray. 😉 

I still love Jesus, as well as you all.
