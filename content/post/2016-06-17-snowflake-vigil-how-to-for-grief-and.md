I mentioned in <a href="https://www.jessicasmarquis.com/post/2016-06-13-snowflake-vigil/">an earlier post</a> that I may do a &#8220;snowflake vigil&#8221; with my kiddos, all under age 4, regarding the tragic mass shooting at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando. It&#8217;s critical to start an ongoing conversation with them even now about loving others, respecting all, and advocacy. If we claim to love Jesus, whose heart was all about justice, we need to also claim verses like this one:  _

_Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those being crushed._

Proverbs 31:8 (NLT)

I talked with my twin 18-month-old sons first, holding a piece of pink paper (it was the only color I could find) and folding it into quadrants. I talked about how good love feels, and that love helps others. I said that someone had made a bad decision that had hurt a lot of people. Each person is made by God and important to Him, so they are important to us, too.
__

_If someone says, &#8220;I love God,&#8221; and hates his brother, he is a liar; for

the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God

whom he has not seen._

1 John 4:20 (NASB)

As I talked, I cut the paper. One of my boys even ripped a piece for me. I then opened it to show them the snowflake we had made, emphasizing again that each person is unique, and Mommy was sad today because these unique people were hurt by someone who was scared and did not show love toward others. &#8220;We won&#8217;t let hate or fear in this house, okay?&#8221; They were squirming, so we said a prayer together for the families, and that God will help us to love and help others.

I did a snowflake with my almost-4-year-old daughter on her own, because I knew she&#8217;d want to take over the process. We talked about how it hurts when others don&#8217;t like us or are mean. I repeated that everyone is created by God and loved by Him, and I told her some of the names of the people who &#8220;got hurt&#8221; by the person who made a bad decision. When I finished talking and praying with her, she wanted to make her own snowflake. We hung up all three snowflakes in our living room so we can point to them and talk about how everyone matters.

It was all very quick, but it established that we are a family who talks about things and how we can take action. It also gave me a chance to grieve these lives lost &#8211; and to let my kids see me care, because they need to know what that looks like.
