Next edition of #TwoPerspectives: The transgender conversation. I’d hoped to wait on this one because it is complex, so I’d prefer to build up to it; however, with recent events involving the potential loss of rights for this demographic it’s been bumped up in the queue.

Before I start, thank you to all who have reached out regarding how this series has impacted you. I know these are tough topics to talk about, and they rarely are without vilifying the other perspective, so I’m glad to hear you are gaining insight on each side of the issues at hand. If you want to read more of them, I've labeled them by their titles in [this series](https://www.jessicasmarquis.com/tags/two-perspectives/).

I’ve been struggling how to start this post. I thought about sharing my first encounter with a trans individual, when I encountered the fascinating work of the late artist Greer Lankton. I thought of giving a metaphor or relating a general experience we’ve all had. The trouble is that all of these are incomplete introductions to trans identity and experience. And that’s part of the many reasons it’s so misunderstood.

When I was in the CWE (conservative White evangelical) church, transgender individuals were not part of the conversation. I think they got lumped in with gay people, and it led to confusion about what trans actually was. I’m going to list below some of the misconceptions I had that got in my way of learning more.

1. Transgender = transvestite, transexual, drag queen, or cross-dresser.
2. Transgender = gay or lesbian.
3. Being trans is a new fad.
4. There are only two sexes, and one’s gender must correspond with their chromosomes.
5. Not accepting one’s biological sex demonstrates a belief that God made a mistake. God doesn’t make mistakes, so this is wrong.
6. Trans individuals are experimenting with different genders - a male today, a female tomorrow. It’s just a phase.
7. If they don’t get over it, it’s a mental illness.
8. The trans community has an agenda to get into spaces reserved for specific genders (e.g., restrooms) to assault others.
9. Trans individuals are not good people.
10. It’s my responsibility to tell a trans person they are sinning.
11. All trans people want to talk about is being trans.
12. Using someone’s preferred pronouns is polite but unnecessary.

That’s a long list. It’s likely why I didn’t do much investigating on the topic - I didn’t know where to begin. I could find info for and against in the LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) conversation, but the T and Q (trans and queer) left me befuddled. And I \*do not\* like feeling befuddled.

I heard that men wearing women’s clothing - and vice versa - was wrong (Deuteronomy 22:5), but that meant I’d have to toss out 85% of my wardrobe in high school. Plus, I was already out of step with Deuteronomy 22 because I really did like my mixed textiles (vs. 11). I had these fabulous plaid wool pants I found in the old-men’s section of the thrift store. They were extremely itchy but had some comfy lining of another fabric in the waist. I paired them with a bowling shirt and my pixie cut - which seemed in contradiction to 1 Corinthians 11:14-15. And if I wasn’t, then my boyfriends probably were because I dated long-haired musicians. Maybe I sound cheeky, but these were actual points used in CWE discussions regarding being trans.

Most commonly, we were sent to Genesis to check out verses 1:27 and 5:2, which said God created male and female.

That’s it.

No further discussion needed.

Except that there was.

Because gender isn’t that simple. In addition to intersex individuals, there are- Ah, crap, you got me addressing #4 in the list above! I haven’t even done the first 3 yet! You all are quite sneaky, aren’t you?

Point is that I didn’t have a clear picture of what being trans meant, and I didn’t have a way to talk about it. So I didn’t.

When I read about the death of the aforementioned trans artist Greer Lankton and the way her pastor father had helped with her sex reassignment surgery (now termed “gender confirmation surgery”), I felt compelled to discover how the supportive congregation had reconciled their faith with this transition. Lost for a starting point from with to explore, I turned to a tried-&-true strategy: lurking. I listened to interviews, watched documentaries, read books, visited web forums, eavesdropped on conversations.

I now have a better understanding, but I’ll never fully get it because I’m cisgender. My sex and gender match. I can’t imagine them not matching. I _can_ imagine what it’s like to feel extremely, hopelessly depressed when I’m supposed to feel happy, and not be able to do anything to change it so I fake happiness but deep down I know where I really am. I can imagine that, but it’s still insufficient.

This is why I’ve asked some friends who are transgender, allies, and Christians with a conservative and/or fundamentalist background to help me address the points above. As my trans friend Julie told me regarding my perspective and role:  

> “…as a cis person you literally cannot ever understand how a trans person feels. That is ok, you don’t have to. I like to give cis people permission to accept that, and that you can stop trying to figure out how we feel. You can’t. We barely understand how we feel, and it is impossible to explain with words… We appreciate the empathy but there are better and easier ways to be an ally.”

My goal of this post is for both the conservative and the left-leaning Christian communities to understand why neither side is hearing the other: They aren’t speaking the same language. I hope to create some translation here so no more lives are lost. No, that isn’t hyperbole, as I’ll get into shortly.  

1. Here’s a [super handy page](http://www.askthegay.com/2010/10/what’s-the-difference-between-transsexual-transgender-transvestite-and-cross-dresser/) that differentiates each term. One common area of confusion is the difference between being trans and cross-dressing. A trans individual’s gender does not match the gender assigned them at birth, so they may wear clothes of another gender to feel more congruent. A cross-dresser is cis and simply enjoys wearing the clothing of another gender.
2. Being transgender is about gender identity, about who someone is. It does not reflect or impact sexuality, and there are straight and gay trans individuals.  
3. Transgender individuals have existed [throughout history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_history), even in ancient times. There has even been discussion about eunuchs in the Bible and how their gender identity fit into God’s plan (Isaiah 56:4, Matthew 19:12). Also of interest to me are those in Native American tribes deemed [“Two Spirit”](https://www.ihs.gov/lgbt/health/twospirit/) - individuals who form a kind of third gender and can act as healers, as well as in other spiritual roles.  
4. Let’s start with [intersex](http://www.isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex) individuals, people who possess reproductive or sexual anatomy that does not fit the typical male and female definitions. They are born this way; it is not a choice. This [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/ScienceVet2/status/1035246030500061184) goes into even more specifics regarding the bimodal distribution of biological sex.   The truth is, male and female are a spectrum, which makes the two Genesis verses examples of [merism](https://www.thoughtco.com/merism-rhetoric-term-1691307). Also, Galatians 3:28 reminds us how, in Jesus, there is no male or female; this leads me to conclude those categories aren’t all that important to Him. 
5. Trans individuals do not necessarily believe God made a mistake. God gave them a different gender from their biological sex, yes, but it was the people around them who have made it difficult for them to express who they truly are. Here are some perspectives from trans people who have addressed the concept of being “a mistake”: \
   [Shannon TL Kearns](http://www.shannontlkearns.com/god-not-make-mistakes-transgender/)\
   [Katie Leone](<https://www.believeoutloud.com/latest/god-made-me-transgender-and-god-does-not-make-mistakes >)
6. If one is truly trans, they will not “grow out of it.” Children may experiment with gender definitions and norms, and some can be termed “gender nonconforming”, but being transgender involves a consistent, persistent, insistence by the individual that they are another gender. \
   \
   How young might this start? Young children may identify as transgender. This is not due to confusion about gender identity; [a study](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/transgender-kids-show-consistent-gender-identity-across-measures.html) comparing trans and cis children ages 5-12 found that the data on the responses about gender identity “were indistinguishable”. \
   \
     There has been some misinformation floating about regarding teens trying out being transgender because it’s a fad. This was due to a misinterpretation and manipulation of statements by a prominent children’s psychiatrist (here is the [actual and correct information](https://www.childrens.health.qld.gov.au/blog-gender-dysphoria-in-children-and-adolescents-is-not-a-phase/?fbclid=IwAR0G9VmHk63DY7swgCHwsQDhw4jO1ot8ql2TWiHhVqpoR_EryLPFFf4wsfM)). There was also a paper released by a professor, but [concerns](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/08/31/journal-looking-study-rapid-onset-gender-dysphoria) arose about the research design and data collection which made the results questionable.  \
   \
   Also, access to info about being trans does not cause someone to become trans. For example, Julie did not know she was trans at an early age, but she always felt a type of “wrongness”, even as a Christian. She did not feel peace. She reports that the sense “only increased in intensity as I aged. I tried really hard to not be trans…It’s like we feel we have to try everything possible and only accept being trans as the last resort. No one wants to be trans.  "\
   \
   Rebekah, Julie’s wife from before transition to present, reiterates this point:
 “No one wants to be treated like they are a freak. No one wants to go through life feeling like they were born in the wrong body. No one wants to pay for surgeries to change secondary sex characteristics that may out them as being trans. When I was in college, I had a short male style haircut. After the third time I was called ‘sir’ I started growing my hair out because it made me uncomfortable thinking people thought I was a man at first glance. That was just a haircut for me. Many trans people live with that kind of feeling everyday - the way the\[y] feel about and see themselves is completely different than how other people see each other. I saw my wife completely shut down and go to a very dark place before she finally accepted she was trans. The change from not being comfortable with herself and not knowing how to go on living a lie to accepting that she was trans and born in the wrong body was almost night and day.”\
   \
   So do people stay trans? If seeing is believing, here are 
   [photos](https://www.advocate.com/photography/2018/9/06/20-photos-trans-elders-who-have-survived-jess-t-dugan)
   from an exhibition on elderly trans individuals. 
 
7. I’ve often heard people joke about being transgender in this way: “So she thinks she’s a guy? Then I think I’m a canary. That’s just as logical.” This leads us into the mental illness conversation, that trans people are “sick” and “need help.” It also leads us to another conversation about proper etiquette and the decline of basic kindness, but that’s another matter. So excuse me while I remove my fiery-mama hat and take a breath. And another breath.  \
   \
   While it’s true that some trans people experience gender dysphoria (a[ DSM 5 diagnosis](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria)), not all do. Plus, gender dysphoria can be addressed in counseling. The goal is not to convince the person to return to their assigned gender, but to help them come to peace with who they are, bringing the inside and the outside into congruence.\
   \
     Which brings us to brain scans. [Researchers reported findings](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/05/22/transgender-brain-scans-promised-study-shows-structural-differences/) that biological males “had a brain structure and neurological patterns similar to biological females, and vice versa.” If you’re interested, you can read [more research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-there-something-unique-about-the-transgender-brain/) that has been done regarding the transgender brain. These are not conclusive studies, but they seem to be leading toward a biological basis for being trans. 

8. I gotta go anecdotal on this before I get into the research. I’m a member of online trans support groups, and I learn a lot by “listening”. The members of these groups often post photos of themselves to ask if they “pass” (as cis). One time, I saw someone comment something intended to be uplifting, like, “You look beautiful! Don’t worry about what others say!” A rapid reply fired back: This isn’t about looking good. This is about passing so as not to get humiliated or beat up. \
   \
     My friends, trans individuals are not looking to be in a restroom to harm others or even make them uncomfortable. _They_ are uncomfortable. [60% of them](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lgbt-survey/u-s-transgender-people-harassed-in-public-restrooms-landmark-survey-idUSKBN13X0BK) report they’ve avoided using the restroom in public to avoid confrontation because they have been harassed or assaulted. \
   \
     As for the effectiveness of having a bill in place to keep trans people from using their chosen restroom, a [2018 study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs13178-018-0335-z) found “that fears of increased safety and privacy violations as a result of nondiscrimination laws are not empirically grounded.”  
9. This one sucks to call out, but it’s the unspoken belief held by many people of faith. Part of it is that they have never encountered a trans person who is out and comfortable with their gender identity. They likely have met a trans person, since a [2016 study](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/06/30/484253324/1-4-million-adults-identify-as-transgender-in-america-study-says) reported that 1.4 million* adults in America identify as trans. However, many remain closeted due to fear for safety and other reasons. It’s hard to fight a stereotype when you don’t have something to fight it with.\
   \
     Although they are few, we have seen depictions of trans people in the media. The problem is that a [survey in 2012](https://www.glaad.org/publications/victims-or-villains-examining-ten-years-transgender-images-television) found that, over 10 years and 102 individual TV episodes featuring transgender characters, 54% of the depictions were negative. in these episodes, 40% of them portrayed the trans person as a victim, and 21% made them the killer or villain. So if that is what is being shown, that is what we tend to believe.   \
   \
   Anecdotally, my friends in the support groups are kind and in search of quality relationships. Many are longing for acceptance from their loved ones. But many of them aren’t out, and don’t know if they ever can be. As a result, the world misses out on what trans people are really like - because the world has made it unsafe for them to be themselves. 

10. One of the recurring themes in my conversations with trans people is the way they have been confronted by those who claim to be Christians. Very few have positive stories of conversations or relationships with anyone of faith. Some have been told to struggle against their gender identity because the fight will improve their relationship with God. Some have been told they must have been deceived into thinking this way. Some have been told, “I love the sinner, but I hate the sin,” which is much less compassionate than the speakers may think. Many are rejected from their places of security and by people they’ve trusted, leaving them alone and vulnerable.   \
    \
    These are contributors to the [statistics](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Executive-Summary-Dec17.pdf) that 40% of trans people in the U.S. attempt suicide, compared to 4.6% in the general population. In fact, for trans people in unsupportive families, the homelessness, attempted suicide, and serious psychological distress rates are significantly higher than their supported trans peers.  \
    \
    Are there transgender Christians who identify as evangelical? Absolutely. In fact, of the respondents to the 2016 Cooperative Congregational Election Study who identified as “born again or evangelical Christian,” [a summary](https://religioninpublic.blog/2017/03/16/religion-gender-and-sexuality/) reported: \
    \
    “Transgender Americans lead the way with 44 percent, while heterosexuals trail with just under 30 percent identifying. As with the religious tradition results, gay men identify with the born again label at the lowest rates (11.5%), though they are not distinguishable from lesbian and bisexual Americans (both 13-14%).”\
\
      There are a lot of trans people with a religious background. Of the respondents to the [2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](http://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF) who stated they had been part of a spiritual or religious community, 19% stated they left due to rejection. \
\
    That isn’t the end of their faith journey, as you can see above; nonetheless, they continue to be seen as broken, Godless projects by many who share the communion table with them. To help others understand what this experience is like, one woman who is trans and Christian [publicly shared](https://www.thelily.com/im-transgender-and-christian-heres-what-i-did-when-evangelicals-tried-to-pray-for-me/) about being approached by evangelists and then leading them in prayer.   \
\
    So do you need to confront these individuals with what you believe about them? No. Many have already heard the spiel, so it’s wasted air. Even more important, that is not how relationships are built or God’s love is shared. On the other hand, that_ is_ a good way to alienate people, wound the wounded, and make yourself an unsafe person to trans individuals - if that’s what you’re going for.  

11. Trans people are more than just one thing. As a matter of fact, contributors to this post remarked they often forget they are trans; they simply don’t talk about it much. They’re too busy blending in, living their lives, and trying to accomplish the same goals we all have: work, groceries, health care, etc. \
    \
    Some - but not all - are open to having conversations if you have legitimate questions about being trans.   As with all people, you must ask respectfully about their comfort level before you continue with any questions. If you get the green light, _do not_ mess it up by being uncouth. In regular conversation, you wouldn’t ask someone, “What sex positions do you prefer?” If you’re shocked by what I just wrote, you can now imagine how it feels for a trans person to be asked, “What work have you had done?” or “What is your _real_ name?”  \
    \
    A very good question to ask, if you can’t think of any, is what they want cis people to know about being trans. (Fun fact: That’s how I got a lot of info for this post.) 
12. What are preferred pronouns? A preferred pronoun identifies how someone wants to be referred to: he/him, she/her, they/them, etc. Regardless how someone appears, we mustn’t assume we know what they want to be called. \
    \
      So how do you find out someone’s preferred pronouns? A trans friend advises, “Ask them.” Simple as that. You can initiate the conversation and make things less uncomfortable for both of you by saying, “My name is \_\_\_\_, and my pronouns are \_\_\_ and \_\_\_.” That opens the door for them to introduce themselves as they want. \
    \
      When someone transitions from their assigned gender, they often leave their name behind, which is termed a “dead name.” Using that name can be upsetting if not triggering, depending on their past experience. Randi, one of my trans friends and an incredibly informed and deep thinker, reminds us that there are people throughout the Bible who adopted new names after a significant life transition: Abram to Abraham, Sarai to Sarah, Saul to Paul. It marks new life.  \
    \
    This means that using preferred pronouns and chosen names is not optional. To refuse to acknowledge those choices is to disrespect the person making them. And there will be grace with learning these new references. A loved one you’ve known for years isn’t going to expect you to adjust to their name and pronouns immediately. Well, they shouldn’t, and most won’t. \
    \
    However, if you’ve just met someone who is trans and you insist on using their dead name or misgendering them through incorrect pronouns, comedian Paul F. Tompkins says this: 

    “‘My name is Robert but I would prefer that you call me Bob.’ It’s just like that. You know what I mean? And if you were to insist upon calling that person Robert, you would be a colossal dick.”

Since I’d rather not end this post with the word “dick”, I will instead thank all those who helped in contributing and editing this post. I know we didn’t cover everything, and if there is something specific you’d like answered by me or by someone who is trans, please let me know!\
\
  Thank you for staying curious, my friends. I love you all so very much.\
