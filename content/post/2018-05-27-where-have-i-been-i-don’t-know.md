Some people have been asking where I’ve been, so I suppose it’s time for the big reveal: I’ve been in a multi-month intensive course on how to say, “I don’t know.”



“How are you?”

“I don’t know.”



“What’s going on?”

“I don’t know.”



“Can I help with anything?”

“I don’t know.”



“Are things getting better?”

“I don’t know.”



How did I score this prestigious educational opportunity? Well, let me tell you! My three-year-old got sick. Then my five-year-old and other three-year-old got sick. Then the first kid downsized his sleep hours. Then the other kids hopped aboard that bandwagon. Then the first kid opted for screaming over sleeping. And his twin brother agreed that was a brilliant idea.



After weeks of getting insufficient sleep from their night terrors, frequent wakings (usually augmented by tantrums), and days that started anytime between 3:30 and 5:00am, my own health gave out.



Here’s what I knew on an unconscious level but hadn’t acknowledged until that moment: My health was the last pillar holding up a series of coping-skill bridges. I began constructing them during my first pregnancy, when my sole strategy was to survive. I did this not just for sleep, but also for relationships, diet, mental stimulation, and all-around life balance.



However, bridges are intended to transport the traveler from solid ground to solid ground. My bridge network was now six years long, with only a handful of stops on stable foundation. It was like trying to build an interstate among the Hawaiian islands and back to the U.S. mainland.



The night my throat flushed with fire and I coiled my chilled body beneath a mesa of blankets, the final pillar cracked. As over half a decade of construction crumbled, every piece of me crashed, too.



I’ve made no secret of my history with depression and anxiety. It’s a proud family tradition, one I’m sure my offspring will carry forth. That’s one reason I’m writing about it, to de-stigmatize what happened during my own breakdown so they have no shame when theirs occur.



The first day, I oscillated between staring absently out the window and shaking with guttural sobs. I couldn’t taste the food I managed to eat, and I cried out all the water I downed. Bob tried to support me, but he had never seen me so broken. We’ve been together for over a decade, through a cross-country move, career transitions, a cumulative total of 13 days of labor, deaths of loved ones, and many rough patches. But this was uncharted territory and, therefore, much more raw.



Stumped – and probably a bit freaked out – by what was transpiring before him, he took a seat on the floor beside the recliner in which I’d pitched a blanket tent for myself.



“What do you need?”

“I don’t know.”



Actually, my response was more garbled, both mucus-laden and incoherent. But the vocal inflection made it through.



I visited my clinician, who put me on a low dose of Lexapro, the antidepressant/anti-anxiety medication that got me through prenatal depression. It didn’t take effect immediately, and apparently it shouldn’t. That sucked for the quick comeback I’d planned.



I shut off the internet and my phone, and I slept a lot. Bob became Mr. Mom, sans the ‘80s hair and hotshot ad exec wife. To explain my demotion from domestic director, we told the kids I was sick and needed rest to get better. They colored me pictures and brought me toys, some of which they wanted me to fix. I set those aside in a pile that I’ll someday attend to.



It took two weeks to find a therapist. That’s absurd. I used to be a counselor, so I can navigate the system. How long does it take for someone without my background to find somebody? I mean, they gather the strength and courage to call someone for help – a huge step! – and then they’re faced with a whole new level of obstacles. That pisses me off. People need an easy time when they face mental health challenges, not a gauntlet, or purgatory.



A therapist eventually called me back who had availability less than a month away. I grabbed the appointment and declared to the kids that I’d be seeing the feelings doctor to heal me. They asked her name, pondered it, and decided they approved.



After a week in counseling and on the meds, the anxiety no longer flooded my body every time a child cried at night. The rolling boil of irritability I’d learned to work around decreased to a slow simmer. While I still experienced several panic attacks a day, and I left a trip to the zoo because of overstimulation, I was able to get out of bed in the morning and feed us all.



The trouble was I kept forgetting to make the food. Hopelessness and stress tag-team body-slammed my attention to the point that my brain could not be bothered with day-to-day activities. Living on a tight budget, we didn’t have extra money to just get takeout. And so when dinner time would arrive, I’d bolt to the freezer and cupboard to see what I could mash together for that night.



That was when other people stepped in. I didn’t ask for it, because I’d been taught that it wasn’t safe to ask. A request for assistance meant that we were weak, that we’d be indebted to the other person, and they would be less willing to help us in the future. I’m not saying the lesson was logical; it just was.



Yet here we were, receiving meals, groceries, a handmade weighted blanket to aid our kiddo’s sleep, and requests from people to babysit our kids. No strings attached. One letter that accompanied a warm dinner said, “…we believe in you and are honored to invest in getting you through tough times so we can celebrate with you the amazing times to come!”



The Lexapro kept me from crying. I would have otherwise.



A friend told me about sleep debt. How did I not know about this? I was living in a deficit the size of the U.S. national debt and thought making occasional $10 payments would get me by. This friend, however, knew me two years ago when one of our kiddos sent me through six months of sleep loss, complete with our boy’s hospitalization, tests, and visits to specialists. My friend saw how delinquent my sleep account had become, and, as a veteran mama, she had no trouble detecting why my bridges broke. With a warm welcome at her front door, she ushered my kids into her house and me outside to go home for a nap.



I began to realize there are two types of people who have been through hell: Those who say, “You need to experience it for yourself because I had to,” and those who say, “I don’t want anyone else to experience what I had to.”



The first type appeals to me. I learn excruciatingly well from trial and error, and I don’t want to begrudge anyone those indelible lessons. This time, though, I was drowning in the channels between the Hawaiian islands, concrete slabs sinking around me. Someone yelling from shore, “Keep going! This is how I learned to swim!” wouldn’t elicit my resolve to overcome. Maybe some curse words, but not resolve. I needed someone to toss me a life preserver or drain the ocean.



I turned my attention to surrounding myself with the second type of hell-survivors. These people give me space, encouraging me to accept that recovery is both slow and unpredictable. For example, I’ve been home the past few days because of a series of panic attacks. These came after a burst of energy that allowed me to venture back out into public. Good days then bad days and jarring moments mixed throughout – it’s not a steady upward climb.



In recounting my crash to a friend who works in a hospital, she described the moms she sees who are admitted for exhaustion.



“The staff aren’t very nice to them,” she remarked. “They think those women are taking advantage of the care, like it’s a spa getaway. I try to explain that they’re just trying to survive. The hospital is not a spa for them. It’s a place where they can rest and be fed.”



Truth be told, I had a fleeting thought of checking into a hospital after that conversation. What deterred me wasn’t the hospital food; I simply didn’t have the capacity to deal with people shaming me for self-care. So I drove home and fed the twins some bread and carrots, put them down for naps, and collapsed into bed until I had to jump up and clean whichever bed had been peed in during nap time.



So, in summary, I’m still broken. And this provides the chance to rebuild on solid ground…when I’m well. Not before then.



This is why I’m saying, “I don’t know.” I used to have an aversion to this three-word combo, not wanting to display uncertainty or inadequacy. These days, though, the sentence is a lot less about uncertainty and more about surrender, giving myself permission to take off the airs I’ve put on. I don’t have the answers, so why waste my scarce mental energy to conjure up some?



Of course, the answer to that question is, “I don’t know.”



On a personal note, to all who have kept my family alive and functioning, feeling loved and supported, thank you. I’ve left your names out because I know a lot of you don’t like your behind-the-scenes work broadcasted, and I’m astounded by your humility. Your actions speak truth to a false narrative that says asking for help is wrong. As a result, we’re teaching our kids to also request it – hopefully before they crash.
