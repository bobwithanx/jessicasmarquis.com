When it feels like your thoughts are out of control or like they&#8217;re controlling you, starting praising God. Say, &#8220;Jesus, You are my Savior. Daddy, I belong to you. You are my King!&#8221; Sing from your heart, clap your hands &#8211; worship like your mind depends on it, because it does! You&#8217;ll be amazed at the clarity you receive when you turn to praise instead of letting your thoughts drag you down.
