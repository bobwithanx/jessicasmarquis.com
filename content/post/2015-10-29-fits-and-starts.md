I am no stranger to inconsistency. I know how to start a project with passion and drive&#8230;and never finish it. I have a spotty history of coming and going in friendships and commitments. And, as a native Detroiter, I have weathered the vacillating reputations of the Pistons and the Tigers (although the Lions have been fairly consistent through the years).

And then something happened.

Namely, The Message version of Ephesians 4:2:

~And mark that you do this with humility and disciplineâ€”not in fits and starts, but steadily, pouring yourselves out for each other in acts of love&#8230;~

&#8220;Fits and starts&#8230;&#8221; Oh man, I did not need to finish reading that passage. The phrase had me pegged, and it felt awful. No matter how well I&#8217;d tried to hide it &#8211; no matter how successful I&#8217;d been at doing so &#8211; I knew I was living inconsistently. And my consistent, unchanging God longed to get me on track and in rhythm.

As I read further in the chapter, Ephesians 4:14 (this time, the NIV) nailed me again:

~Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves,

and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning

and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.~

&#8220;Tossed back and forth&#8230;&#8221; Yep, guilty again. I was an immature threenager who just wanted new new new! I loved me some new trends, new insights, new voices. But this thirst for novelty was causing me to wander away from the solidness of The Truth.

And so I relinquished my fits and starts in favor of the seeming boringness of consistency. It took a lot of practice and some embarrassing accountability, but my loving Daddy finally has me on the right path. I&#8217;m still not always great at it &#8211; my personality type is not known for its conventionality &#8211; but God&#8217;s grace covers my flaws.

And Ephesians 4:2, after punching me in the gut, taught me to stay humble as I learn this life of discipline.
