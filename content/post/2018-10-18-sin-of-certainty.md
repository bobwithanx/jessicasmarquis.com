How many times have I confessed the “sin” of doubt? How many times have I promised God, “I’ll trust you!” then reneged on it? I used to beat myself up for it, naming “doubt” as my weakness. My faith tradition supported this call to repentance. “More faith!” was the second most common Sunday school answer (after “Jesus”).

And then I realized doubt was actually one of my superpowers. 

Call me Doubtera. 

Or something cooler - I’m not wasting mental energy on it. 

Yet.

Point is that I learned to honor doubt. It kept me from swallowing inadequate philosophical bait and bizarre contortional-logic lures. Doubt kept me swimming and dodging both carnivorous predators and fishermen - which were also carnivorous predators.

I soon came to see that doubt’s opposite isn’t faith, as I’d been taught; the opposite of doubt is certainty. Certainty keeps us from questioning, revisiting established beliefs and social mores. It assassinates humility and erects a monument to rigidity. “Assassinate” may seem like a harsh verb, but think of someone in your life who has never budged on a topic, always holding to the same view and reasoning without wavering. Is that person humble? Is that person compassionate? Is that person stunted in their personal growth so you can’t have a real back-and-forth conversation around that issue?

Releasing a belief allows it to either float away as invalid or return with greater conviction. I’d rather doubt and release the erroneous stuff than keep it with me out of fear and protection of self/tradition.

Tonight at church, I confessed for the first time my sin of certainty. Pursuing right-and-wrong answers in a world full of spectrums (spectra? Don’t stop me, ‘cause I’m on a roll!) is a futile and divisive task. Certainty eliminates the potential for exploration, creating an impermeable structure that vilifies those who dare to challenge it. To this effect, I have found great solace In the words of author Madeleine L’Engle, with which I will close:

“Neither our knowledge of God and his purposes for his creation, nor the discoveries of science are static. I must admit that the scientists are often easier for me to understand than the theologians, for many theologians say, ‘These are the final answers.’ Whereas the scientists—correction: the best of them—say, ‘This is how it appears now. If further evidence is to the contrary, we will see where it leads us.’ And of course I’m being unfair to the theologians. The best of them, too, are open to this uncertainty, which is closer to the truth which will set us free than any closed system.”

Amen.
