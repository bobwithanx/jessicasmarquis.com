Temptation doesn&#8217;t just mean lust. For some of us, the temptation is to react in anger, judge others, please others, or overeat; for others, the temptation is to get bogged down by our past or give in to anxiety about our future.

Temptation will affect us all &#8211; _especially_ when we&#8217;re striving to obey our loving Daddy. The temptation is not sin; the response to it can be. The great news is our All-Powerful Defender gives us the power to resist temptation! When we feel the tentacles of temptation, we need to cry out in praise & prayer to Him, and He _will_ provide a way out or through it for us. (1 Corinthians 10:13)

~When Satan tempts me to despair  
And tells me of the guilt within,  
Upward I look and see Him there  
Who made an end of all my sin.~  
-Charitie L Bancroft
