I’m about to do something that is contrary to my nature, which is why I need to do it. While I’m getting better at not hiding my weaknesses - and there are many - I’m still an underachiever when it comes to giving details in the midst of the yuck. So here goes.

Our youngest kiddo is being admitted to the hospital tomorrow. This is the one I alluded to in my blog post a few months ago regarding sleep issues, and the one who went through some major crap back in 2016. We’re not sure what’s up. If this were a ‘House’ episode, he’d have a team of earnest residents yelling out stuff like “Sarcoidosis!” and “Lupus!” and then scribbling on a white board to narrow all the symptoms down to one diagnosis. Because it can’t be all these things. It has to be one thing. You know, Occam’s Razor and whatnot.

I’m not nervous about the hospitalization. It’s an inconvenience, yes, and I’m grieved that my duckling must go through the discomfort of tubes and tests. Nonetheless, I have many friends reading this who have kiddos who have gone through much worse, are going through much worse, will be going through much worse. Please note that I’m not minimizing my story here; I’m simply not glorifying it. All I want to do is be honest because I have a lot of people who have expressed care and desire to help, and I’m not sure what to do with that.

See, one of my favorite memoirs received a review from a less-than-impressed critic. The critic opined that the author appeared to still be in the process of her story and should therefore have waited longer to write about it. That burned me up, because we need more stories written from the middle. That’s where so many of us exist.

Trouble is that we come from a culture that prizes a clean package of beginning, middle, and end. Story is static, and transformation stops at the final page of the book. Ambiguity can exist but must be mitigated so the listener doesn’t get confused (even though the one living the story certainly is). If some form of resolution hasn’t been reached, the story isn’t complete (i.e., valuable) and mustn’t yet be told.

I’m telling this story from the middle. Truth is, I don’t know what he’s going in for. I know the ward he’ll be in and the type of test they are doing, but I don’t know if this will lead us to the root cause so we can relieve the…pain? disturbance? disorder? extended growth spurt? I don’t know.

We spent time with a neurologist earlier this week and ruled that out. Had I written this post before that appointment, I would have included that as a possibility. Story evolves as we live it, and I dislike sharing it as the details shift, becoming more or less relevant from moment to moment.

But I’m doing it because this is what lament looks like. This is what ambiguity looks like and what it provokes. This is what we hide, what I want to hide, because I don’t know. I don’t know what to tell you. If this were the Holy Weekend, I’d be between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, wandering and languishing in the dark, amorphous mess called Holy Saturday.

I’m not sure when I’ll have an update. It may be a concise, “We have an answer!” or it may be an emoji-heavy, “Back to the white board, residents.” This story’s middle may be stretched like taffy, and I’ll find myself grimacing at this post years later in the taffy timeline. Still, I need you to bear witness to this moment because I don’t want you to.

Thank you, my friends.
