we ripped 3 links off the blue paper chain hanging in our bedroom this morning.
the chain represents our debt, each link being $1,000.

there was a time in my life when spending $1,000 was an absurd thought.
however, i came into this marriage with

$7,000 of debt that i owed on my car
+ $5,000 remaining on my school loan.
\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\___\____
$12,000 in the hole.

add that to what bob had being a homeowner with a mortgage,
and our chain was too long for us not to notice it.

since day 1 of our marriage, we&#8217;ve been working to rip off those paper links.
there is a growing stack of blue construction-paper strips on our shelf,
and we&#8217;re salivating for the finish line.
(i know, it&#8217;s a weird metaphor.)

passion this year means not allowing someone else to control our finances &, consequently, our lives.

being free of debt will allow us to
&#8220;live like no one else,&#8221;
to borrow dave ramsey&#8217;s quote.

our goal is to be out of this money vacuum by bob&#8217;s birthday next month.
with &#8220;gazelle-like intensity&#8221; (another dave-ism), we&#8217;re zeroing in on that target.
will those remaining 7 links dissolve in the next 34 days?
stay tuned&#8230;

~don&#8217;t run up debts, except for the huge debt of love you owe each other.~
