Once upon a time, people worshiped idols. They were made of wood or clay or stone. They looked like creatures, and they couldn&#8217;t do anything. These ancient people were silly for thinking the idols could help them. Now, we are so much better and smarter, and we don&#8217;t have idols.

This was the story I told myself growing up in the Church.
  
And then my Sunday school teacher informed me TV could be an idol. That didn&#8217;t quite jive with my definitions of idols. TV didn&#8217;t look like a monkey or a human with extra appendages. So she explained it to me. 
  
Thus, I expanded my definition to be something to which you give lots of time and attention.

And then my pastor told me work could be an idol.
  
Okay, I could understand the TV thing, since it was a physical entity. But work was intangible. How could people bow to it? So he explained it to me.
  
Thus, I expanded my definition to be something to which you give space in your heart where other life-giving things have more claim.

And then an author told me family could be an idol.
  
What the&#8230;?
  
This one was a bit too out there for my operational definition. Wasn&#8217;t family a thing the Church loved, a thing that brought life, that embodies love and exemplifies community? How could it be an idol? So the Spirit explained it to me.
  
Thus, I expanded my definition to be anything that can become my prime motivation, crowding God off His throne in my life.

That revision caused just about everything else in my life to light up as potential idols: Approval, fear, helping others, knowledge, grudges, dreams, theology, identity, exercising (okay, not really, but I kinda wish exercising was something I struggled with idolizing).&nbsp; **Anything that occupied my thoughts and informed my goals more than my Savior would end up in His crosshairs. He&#8217;s a jealous God; He wants all of my heart.**

Family is a beautiful thing, but it must never get in the way of what God is calling us into. We need to regularly surrender our spouse, kids, parents, siblings &#8211; or our desire for these things &#8211; to the One who gives them to us. We need to keep a loose grip so He can slide His hand in there at any time (for _all_ of our best).

When my son was ill and eventually ended up in the hospital, it rocked me. No mom wants to hear the pediatrician say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve tried everything. It&#8217;s time to admit him.&#8221; But having him in my open hand, knowing he was on loan to me by his Creator &#8211; _our_ Creator &#8211; made the journey one where I was walking alongside that Creator instead of fighting Him. It made it a sweet adventure even amidst the uncertainty, and the healing that much more dynamic.

**We all struggle with idols, no matter how self-aware, humble, or God-focused we are. Once we accept that basic truth of our humanity, we can then begin to identify what needs to be dethroned.&nbsp;**

Jessica&#8217;s Idol Identification-and-Removal Routine:

1. Ask, &#8220;What, if taken from me, do I believe would ruin me irreversibly?&#8221;

2. Once the Spirit answers and shows you an idol, don&#8217;t deny it. You&#8217;ll eventually have to let go of it anyway, so my recommendation (from experience) is to do it sooner and voluntarily, rather than later and with a lot more discomfort. It&#8217;s like tending to a splinter: Pull it out when you see it, rather than letting it stay, start an infection, and require surgery.

3. Invite the King back to His throne. What makes an idol &#8211; thinking it can help you, time, attention, space in your heart, being your motivation &#8211; is also what restores your King to His rightful place. 

4. Repeat. Regularly.
