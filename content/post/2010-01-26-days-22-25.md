i&#8217;ve been off the grid, indulging a growing passion:

  bob, a team of PHX creatives, & i made a full microshort this weekend.


          we&#8217;ve been making films together since we met:

          he directs, i write, & we make magic happen.

          it&#8217;s tough working so closely & intensely sometimes,

          and we&#8217;ve learned a lot about teamwork through it all.


          i guess my passion for making films goes hand-in-hand with my passion for my marriage.

          i see them as linked, since they have been since day 1.

          i mean, we met because of a video camera!

          (for that story, <a href="http://www.redbookmag.com/love-sex/advice/tattoo-keeps-couple-close?click=main_sr">here is the article.</a>)


          my trouble is that i can be extremely passionate,

          and when something goes awry i don&#8217;t know how else to react but to smother my flame.

          it&#8217;s like i&#8217;m saying,

          &#8220;if this isn&#8217;t going to go my way, i&#8217;ll just pretend i don&#8217;t care at all.&#8221;

          self-sabotage.

          neither films nor good marriages get made that way.


          this year, passion means keeping the flame alive even when the wind blows,

          the oxygen is all but gone,

          and all i want to do is snuff out the wick.

          it means fanning the flame & believing that a fire can result.
