Okay friends, I've done a disservice to a group of people I respect, and I want to make that right tonight. I'll get right to it. I've been posting in support of the LGBTQ community, recognizing the courage & sacrifice required to come out.

However, I had not created space in this conversation for those who have not come out.

These individuals carry the truth with them at all times, but they believe they have to hide it. They may want to come out, or they may think they need to live with the secret. Whatever their situation, please believe it is hard. They relate to the experience of the LGBTQ community, but they can't visibly celebrate, grieve, or connect with it.

As a bystander it's easy to exclaim, "Just come out!" or, "Just get over it!" but that doesn't take into consideration all the complications each of those options introduces. You don't know their experience or their needs. Yes, it may help the community if they shook off the shackles of heteronormative society, but it may not be in their personal best interest at this time.

So to those who are in the closet, I see you. I won't out you. I respect your need to stay there right now. You will receive pressure to come out, and there are certainly benefits. Regardless of where you are in your process, please protect yourself. Have a plan, have a support group, and have the desire to do so. This is your story.

If you need support in this process, contact [Belong](http://ambercantorna.com/about/about-beyond).

In the meantime, there is room for you at the table, regardless of how you do - or don't - identify. And we can wave a tiny üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà flag together when no one is looking.

Let me be absolutely clear, though: Allies, this post does not apply to you. You need to come out with your support. Your silence is one of the reasons these loved ones are still hiding.
