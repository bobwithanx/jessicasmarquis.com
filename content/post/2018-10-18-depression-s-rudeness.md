When someone doesn’t appear to be listening or doesn’t ask us about ourselves, we tend to think them rude. Please keep this in mind:

Depression can look like rudeness.

We can’t focus on helping to plug others’ leaks when our own dam has broken.

So if you notice someone isolating themself and alienating others more than usual, and IF YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY, ask them in a safe setting how they’re doing. Listen without judgment or pity. And, for the love of all that is holy/chocolate, don’t offer solutions.

If you don’t have the capacity, still let them know you value them. You know what would be really awesome? If, vulnerably, you told them why you don’t have the capacity. It would be incredible to create that moment for possible authentic connection.

But you don’t have to. You need to know and respect your own limits. Just don’t think we’re jerks when we don’t seem interested. Please give grace. We’re all humans; no one is impermeable to pain.
