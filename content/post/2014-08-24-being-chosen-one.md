I&#8217;m about to get a big sci-fi-geeky here, but bear with me because I think you&#8217;ll be encouraged by the end. 

I&#8217;ve been reading Bill Hybels&#8217; call-to-passion book _Holy Discontent_, and I realized how we all kinda want to be Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, Queen Esther, Sydney Bristow in _Alias_, Bethany Sloane in _Dogma_, and all those other &#8220;chosen ones&#8221;. As audience members, we relate with these characters because we rather like the idea of having ancient writings foretell our coming, or other people recognize us as the person who will accomplish what needs to be done. We want to be selected for a specific mission that only we can do.

And here&#8217;s the awesome news: _WE ARE!_ Our loving Daddy, Creator of time & the universe, Giver of all good things, put you on the earth for the time you are here to do something only you can do. Isn&#8217;t that incredible? You are Neo in _The_ _Matrix_!

So be who God has empowered, equipped, & designed you to be, whether it is saving the galaxy, raising an amazing kiddo in spite of hardship, or living your light in front of people at work who couldn&#8217;t hear the Good News from anyone else.

~For we are God&#8217;s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.~  
Ephesians 2:10
